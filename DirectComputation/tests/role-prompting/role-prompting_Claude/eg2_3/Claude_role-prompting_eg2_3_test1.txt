PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
Let me read and analyze your CSV file to extract the formal concepts from this context.

Now let me explain this step by step as your computer science teacher would:

## Understanding Formal Concept Analysis

**What is a Formal Context?**
Your CSV represents a formal context with:
- **Objects**: {o1, o2} 
- **Attributes**: {a1, a2, a3}
- **Incidence relation**: Shows which objects have which attributes

**What is a Formal Concept?**
A formal concept is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is a set of objects (called the **extent**)
- B is a set of attributes (called the **intent**)
- A contains exactly those objects that have ALL attributes in B
- B contains exactly those attributes that are shared by ALL objects in A

**The Four Concepts in Your Example:**

1. **Top Concept (⊤)**: (∅, {a1,a2,a3})
   - No objects satisfy having ALL three attributes simultaneously

2. **Object o1 Concept**: ({o1}, {a1,a2})
   - Object o1 has exactly attributes a1 and a2

3. **Object o2 Concept**: ({o2}, {a2,a3})
   - Object o2 has exactly attributes a2 and a3

4. **Bottom Concept (⊥)**: ({o1,o2}, {a2})
   - Both objects share only attribute a2

**Why This Forms a Lattice:**
The concepts form a complete lattice because:
- There's a partial ordering based on extent inclusion
- Every pair of concepts has a unique meet (greatest lower bound) and join (least upper bound)
- The structure has a unique top and bottom element

This lattice helps us understand the hierarchical relationships between different combinations of objects and their shared properties in your dataset.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here's the complete list of all formal concepts from your context in the requested format:

**[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]**

Each concept is represented as [intent, extent] where:
- First element: list of attributes (intent)
- Second element: list of objects (extent)

The four concepts are:
1. [[a1, a2, a3], []] - Top concept with all attributes, no objects
2. [[a1, a2], [o1]] - Object o1 with its attributes a1, a2  
3. [[a2, a3], [o2]] - Object o2 with its attributes a2, a3
4. [[a2], [o1, o2]] - Bottom concept with common attribute a2, all objects
