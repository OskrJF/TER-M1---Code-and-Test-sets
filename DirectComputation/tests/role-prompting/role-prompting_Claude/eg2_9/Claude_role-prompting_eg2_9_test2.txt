PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll help you understand formal concept analysis by extracting all lattice concepts from this context. Let me start by explaining what we're working with and then systematically find all the concepts.

Now let me walk you through the formal concept analysis step by step:

## What is Formal Concept Analysis?

In FCA, we work with a **formal context** consisting of objects, attributes, and their relationships. From your CSV data, we have:
- **Objects**: o1, o2 
- **Attributes**: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9
- **Relations**: which objects have which attributes (yes/no values)

## The Key Principle

A **formal concept** is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is a set of objects (called the **extent**)
- B is a set of attributes (called the **intent**)
- A contains exactly those objects that have all attributes in B
- B contains exactly those attributes shared by all objects in A

This creates a "maximal rectangle" in the context table.

## The Extracted Concepts

From your data, we get exactly **4 formal concepts**:

1. **Concept 1**: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})
   - Both objects share attributes a1, a4, and a9

2. **Concept 2**: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})
   - Object o1 has these specific attributes

3. **Concept 3**: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})
   - Object o2 has these specific attributes

4. **Concept 4**: (âˆ…, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a8, a9})
   - Empty extent with maximal intent (bottom concept)

## Why These Are All the Concepts

The algorithm checks every possible subset of objects and computes their shared attributes, then verifies the closure property. These 4 concepts form a complete concept lattice where:
- The top concept has maximal extent (both objects)
- The bottom concept has maximal intent (most attributes)
- Each concept represents a meaningful grouping in your data

This lattice structure helps reveal the hierarchical relationships and common patterns in your dataset!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Looking at the formal concepts I extracted from your CSV data, here they are in the requested format:

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]

Each concept is represented as [extent, intent] where:
- First concept: empty extent with maximal intent (bottom concept)
- Second concept: object o1 with its specific attributes
- Third concept: object o2 with its specific attributes  
- Fourth concept: both objects with their shared attributes (top concept)
