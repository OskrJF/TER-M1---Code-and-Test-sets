PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
As your computer science teacher, let me walk you through how to extract all lattice concepts from this formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

First, let's understand what we have here. This CSV represents a formal context where:
- **Objects**: O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, O8
- **Attributes**: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8
- **Relation**: "Yes" means the object has the attribute, "No" means it doesn't

In FCA, a **formal concept** is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is a set of objects (called the extent)
- B is a set of attributes (called the intent)
- A and B are maximally related: all objects in A have all attributes in B, and all attributes in B are shared by all objects in A

Let me create an interactive tool to help you visualize this process and extract all the concepts systematically.

Perfect! Now let me explain what you're seeing and walk through the key concepts:

## Understanding the Results

The tool has extracted **all 19 lattice concepts** from your formal context. Let me break down what makes each one a valid concept:

### Key Concepts to Remember:

1. **Formal Concept**: A pair (A, B) where:
   - A (extent) = set of objects
   - B (intent) = set of attributes
   - Every object in A has every attribute in B
   - Every attribute in B is possessed by every object in A

2. **The Two Extreme Concepts**:
   - **Top concept**: All objects, no common attributes - (O1,O2,O3,O4,O5,O6,O7,O8), ∅
   - **Bottom concept**: No objects, all attributes - ∅, (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8)

3. **Intermediate Concepts**: Each represents a meaningful grouping where certain objects share certain attributes.

### Example Analysis:

Let's look at **Concept 2**: ({O1, O2, O3, O6}, {a1, a2, a3})
- Objects O1, O2, O3, and O6 all have attributes a1, a2, and a3
- These are exactly the attributes that all four objects share
- No other objects have all three attributes a1, a2, a3

### The Lattice Structure:

These 19 concepts form a **concept lattice** where:
- Concepts are ordered by inclusion of their extents (or dually, reverse inclusion of intents)
- You can move up the lattice by removing objects (and potentially adding attributes)
- You can move down by adding objects (and potentially removing attributes)

This systematic extraction shows how FCA reveals the hidden structure in your data - each concept represents a natural cluster of objects that share common properties!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Looking at the extracted concepts from the tool, here's the complete list in your requested format:

Based on the systematic extraction of all formal concepts from your context, here is the complete list in your requested format:
