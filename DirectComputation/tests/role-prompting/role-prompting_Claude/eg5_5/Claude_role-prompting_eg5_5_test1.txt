PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll help you understand how to extract lattice concepts from this formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Let me walk you through this step by step.

As your computer science teacher, let me walk you through the complete process of extracting formal concepts from this context.

**What we just analyzed:**

From the CSV file, we have a formal context with 5 objects (o1-o5) and 5 attributes (a1-a5). Using the fundamental principle of FCA - that a formal concept is a maximal rectangle of crosses in the context table - we systematically found all 8 formal concepts.

**The key insight:** Each concept represents a meaningful relationship between a set of objects and their common attributes. For example:
- Concept 5 shows that objects o1 and o3 are similar because they both have attributes a1 and a4
- Concept 7 reveals that o3, o4, and o5 form a natural grouping around attribute a2

**Why this matters in computer science:**
- **Data Mining**: Concepts reveal hidden patterns in data
- **Knowledge Representation**: The lattice structure shows hierarchical relationships
- **Machine Learning**: Concept lattices can be used for classification and clustering
- **Database Design**: Helps identify functional dependencies

The interactive visualization above lets you explore each concept and understand how they form a complete lattice structure. Try clicking on different concepts to see their relationships!

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect in more detail, such as the algorithm for computing concept closures or how to interpret the lattice ordering?

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a3], [o2]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]]]
