Prompt:


PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Thanks again! Let's now **reprocess this exact context** step-by-step to ensure 100% accuracy and extract **all formal concepts** using **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**.

### âœ… Step 1: Parse the Context

| Objet  | a1  | a2  | a3  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| **o1** | yes | yes | no  |
| **o2** | no  | yes | yes |

**Incidence relation (I)**:

* **o1** has {a1, a2}
* **o2** has {a2, a3}

So we define:

* **Objects** $G = \{o1, o2\}$
* **Attributes** $M = \{a1, a2, a3\}$

---

### âœ… Step 2: Find All Formal Concepts

We compute all pairs $(A, B)$ such that:

* $A' = B$: All attributes common to all objects in $A$
* $B' = A$: All objects that have all attributes in $B$

---

### âœ… Final Answer â€” Your Required Format

```
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Explanation of Concepts

Each pair `[[intent], [extent]]` means:

* The objects in the extent all share the attributes in the intent.
* The attributes in the intent are exactly the ones shared by the objects in the extent.

For example:

* `[[a2], [o1, o2]]` â€” both o1 and o2 share a2.
* `[[a1], [o1]]` â€” only o1 has a1.
* `[[a1, a2, a3], []]` â€” no object has all three attributes.

Let me know if you want the concept lattice visualized or if you'd like Python code to compute this from any `.csv`!
