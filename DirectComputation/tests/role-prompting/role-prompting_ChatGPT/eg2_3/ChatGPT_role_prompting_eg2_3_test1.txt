Prompt:


PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Perfect! You've provided the following **formal context**:

|        | a1 | a2 | a3 |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- |
| **o1** | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚ùå  |
| **o2** | ‚ùå  | ‚úîÔ∏è | ‚úîÔ∏è |

We interpret "yes" as indicating a relation (i.e., the object has that attribute), and "no" as its absence.

### üìä Step-by-step Breakdown (for the class):

Let‚Äôs define:

* $G = \{o1, o2\}$
* $M = \{a1, a2, a3\}$
* The incidence relation $I$:

  * o1 ‚Üí a1, a2
  * o2 ‚Üí a2, a3

We now compute all **formal concepts**, which are pairs $(A, B)$ where:

* $B = A'$: all common attributes of objects in $A$
* $A = B'$: all objects that share attributes in $B$

### ‚úÖ All Formal Concepts

In your requested format (no quotes, single line):

```
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
```

---

### üß† Explanation:

* `[[a2], [o1, o2]]` means: attribute `a2` is common to both `o1` and `o2`
* `[[a1], [o1]]` means: only `o1` has `a1`
* `[[a1, a2, a3], []]` is a formal concept with **no object** that satisfies **all three attributes** ‚Äî still valid!

Let me know if you want this represented as a **Hasse diagram** or need further explanation of the lattice structure!
