OUTPUT:
Great! Let's walk through this step-by-step as if we're in a computer science class studying **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**.

---

### ðŸ”· Step 1: Understanding the Context Table

We are given a formal context â€” a cross table indicating which objects have which attributes:

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a5  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o1     | yes | no  | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | no  | yes | no  | no  |
| o3     | yes | yes | no  | yes | yes |
| o4     | no  | yes | no  | no  | yes |
| o5     | no  | yes | no  | no  | no  |

---

### ðŸ”· Step 2: Basic Terminology

In FCA, a **formal concept** is a pair **(Extent, Intent)** where:

* **Extent** is the set of objects that share all the attributes in the intent.
* **Intent** is the set of attributes common to all objects in the extent.

These concepts form a **concept lattice** when ordered by inclusion.

---

### ðŸ”· Step 3: Calculating Concepts

We'll compute all formal concepts from the context. To do this, we can use the **Next Closure algorithm** or brute-force approach for small tables like this.

We'll define:

* **G**: the set of all objects = {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
* **M**: the set of all attributes = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}

Letâ€™s compute all concepts manually.

---

### âœ… All Formal Concepts:

We compute each **intent**, then determine the **extent** â€” or vice versa.

#### Concept 1:

* Extent: {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
* Intent: âˆ… (no attribute shared by all)

#### Concept 2:

* Intent: {a3}
* Extent: {o1, o2}

#### Concept 3:

* Intent: {a2}
* Extent: {o3, o4, o5}

#### Concept 4:

* Intent: {a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4}

#### Concept 5:

* Intent: {a1}
* Extent: {o1, o3}

#### Concept 6:

* Intent: {a4}
* Extent: {o1, o3}

#### Concept 7:

* Intent: {a2, a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4}

#### Concept 8:

* Intent: {a1, a4}
* Extent: {o1, o3}

#### Concept 9:

* Intent: {a1, a4, a3}
* Extent: {o1}

#### Concept 10:

* Intent: {a1, a2, a4, a5}
* Extent: {o3}

#### Concept 11:

* Intent: {a2, a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4} â†’ Already listed

#### Concept 12:

* Intent: {a2, a5, a1}
* Extent: {o3}

#### Concept 13:

* Intent: {a2, a5, a4}
* Extent: {o3}

#### Concept 14:

* Intent: {a2, a5, a1, a4}
* Extent: {o3}

#### Concept 15:

* Intent: {a2, a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4} â†’ again already listed

#### Concept 16:

* Intent: {a2, a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4} (repeats because it's stable)

#### Concept 17:

* Intent: {a2, a5}
* Extent: {o3, o4}

#### Concept 18:

* Intent: {a2}
* Extent: {o3, o4, o5}

(You can see how intents repeat for the same extents â€” the number of unique concepts is finite.)

### ðŸ”¢ Final Unique Concepts (Enumerated):

We can now list the **distinct** formal concepts:

1. ({o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}, âˆ…)
2. ({o1, o2}, {a3})
3. ({o3, o4, o5}, {a2})
4. ({o3, o4}, {a2, a5})
5. ({o1, o3}, {a1, a4})
6. ({o1}, {a1, a3, a4})
7. ({o3}, {a1, a2, a4, a5})
8. ({o4}, {a2, a5})
9. ({o5}, {a2})
10. ({o2}, {a3})
11. ({o1, o3}, {a4})
12. ({o3, o4}, {a5})

### âœ… Total: 12 Unique Formal Concepts

These form the nodes of the **concept lattice**, where each concept is ordered by inclusion of extents (or dually by reverse inclusion of intents).

Would you like me to draw the **concept lattice diagram** for this?

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Sure! Here's the list of all unique formal concepts from your context, in the requested format:

```
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a4], [o1, o3]], [[a5], [o3, o4]]]
