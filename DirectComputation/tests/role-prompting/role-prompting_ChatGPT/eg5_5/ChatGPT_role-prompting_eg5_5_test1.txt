OUTPUT:
Great! Let's dive into **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)** with the goal of extracting **formal concepts** (or lattice concepts) from a **formal context**.

---

### 👨‍🏫 Background: What is FCA?

In FCA, we analyze data structured in a **formal context**, which is a table consisting of:

* **Objects** (here: o1 to o5),
* **Attributes** (here: a1 to a5),
* A binary relation (here: *yes* = the object has the attribute, *no* = it doesn't).

Each **formal concept** is a pair:

* **Extent**: a set of objects,
* **Intent**: a set of attributes,
  such that:

1. Every object in the extent has all the attributes in the intent,
2. Every attribute in the intent is shared by all objects in the extent.

---

### 🧮 Step-by-step: Finding Formal Concepts

Let's denote:

* **G**: set of objects = {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
* **M**: set of attributes = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}

We will compute the **closure system** — that is, the set of all (extent, intent) pairs.

We apply a **derivation operator**:

* For a set of objects $A \subseteq G$, $A'$ is the set of all attributes shared by all objects in $A$.
* For a set of attributes $B \subseteq M$, $B'$ is the set of all objects having all attributes in $B$.
* A formal concept is a pair $(A, B)$ such that $A' = B$ and $B' = A$.

### 📋 Given Context Table

| Object | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| o1     | ✔️ | ❌  | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌  |
| o2     | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  |
| o3     | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌  | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| o4     | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️ |
| o5     | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  | ❌  |

### 🔎 Extracting All Formal Concepts

Let’s find all combinations of objects (subsets of G), compute their attribute closure, and test for concept validity.

Below are all formal concepts extracted:

| #  | Extent               | Intent               |
| -- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1  | {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5} | {}                   |
| 2  | {o2}                 | {a3}                 |
| 3  | {o1, o2}             | {a3}                 |
| 4  | {o1}                 | {a1, a3, a4}         |
| 5  | {o3}                 | {a1, a2, a4, a5}     |
| 6  | {o4, o5}             | {a2}                 |
| 7  | {o3, o4}             | {a2, a5}             |
| 8  | {o3, o4, o5}         | {a2}                 |
| 9  | {o4}                 | {a2, a5}             |
| 10 | {o5}                 | {a2}                 |
| 11 | {o1, o3}             | {a1, a4}             |
| 12 | {o3, o5}             | {a2}                 |
| 13 | {}                   | {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} |

✔️ **Total Concepts Found: 13**

---

### 🧠 Interpretation

* Concept 1 is the **bottom** concept (all objects, no attributes).
* Concept 13 is the **top** concept (no objects, all attributes).
* All others form the **body** of the concept lattice.

Would you like me to draw the **concept lattice diagram** for these concepts or explain how to build it?

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Sure! Here's the list of all formal concepts from your context, formatted in a single line as requested:

```
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2], [o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
