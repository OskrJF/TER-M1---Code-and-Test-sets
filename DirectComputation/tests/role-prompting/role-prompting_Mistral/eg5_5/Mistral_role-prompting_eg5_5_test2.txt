PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

OUTPUT:
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a method used to analyze data and identify conceptual structures within it. The data is typically represented in a formal context, which is a triplet consisting of a set of objects, a set of attributes, and a binary relation between them.

Given your formal context, we can extract the lattice concepts. A lattice concept in FCA is a pair (A, B), where A is a set of objects and B is a set of attributes, such that A is the set of all objects that have all attributes in B, and B is the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A.

Let's extract the lattice concepts from your given context:

### Formal Context:
| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| no | yes| yes| no |
| o2    | no | no | yes| no | no |
| o3    | yes| yes| no | yes| yes|
| o4    | no | yes| no | no | yes|
| o5    | no | yes| no | no | no |

### Step-by-Step Extraction of Lattice Concepts:

1. **Concept 1:**
   - Objects: {o1, o3}
   - Attributes: {a1, a4}
   - Explanation: Both o1 and o3 have attributes a1 and a4.

2. **Concept 2:**
   - Objects: {o2}
   - Attributes: {a3}
   - Explanation: o2 is the only object with attribute a3.

3. **Concept 3:**
   - Objects: {o3, o4}
   - Attributes: {a2, a5}
   - Explanation: Both o3 and o4 have attributes a2 and a5.

4. **Concept 4:**
   - Objects: {o3, o4, o5}
   - Attributes: {a2}
   - Explanation: o3, o4, and o5 all have attribute a2.

5. **Concept 5:**
   - Objects: {o5}
   - Attributes: {}
   - Explanation: o5 has no unique attributes not shared by others.

6. **Concept 6:**
   - Objects: {}
   - Attributes: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}
   - Explanation: The empty set of objects corresponds to all attributes.

### Lattice Concepts:
| Concept | Objects | Attributes |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 1       | {o1, o3}| {a1, a4}   |
| 2       | {o2}    | {a3}       |
| 3       | {o3, o4}| {a2, a5}   |
| 4       | {o3, o4, o5}| {a2}   |
| 5       | {o5}    | {}         |
| 6       | {}      | {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} |

These are the lattice concepts extracted from the given formal context. Each concept represents a maximal set of objects sharing a specific set of attributes.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[], [o5]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
