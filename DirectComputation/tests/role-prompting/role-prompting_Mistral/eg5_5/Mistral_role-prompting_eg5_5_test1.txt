OUTPUT:
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a method used to analyze data and identify conceptual structures within it. The data is typically represented in a formal context, which is a triplet consisting of a set of objects, a set of attributes, and a binary relation between them.

In your provided context, we have a table with objects (o1, o2, o3, o4, o5) and attributes (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5). The table indicates whether an object has a particular attribute (yes/no).

To extract lattice concepts, we need to find all pairs of object sets and attribute sets that form a "concept". A concept is defined as a pair (A, B), where A is a set of objects, B is a set of attributes, and the following two conditions hold:

1. All objects in A have all attributes in B.
2. No other object outside A has all attributes in B, and no other attribute outside B is common to all objects in A.

Let's go through the process of identifying these concepts:

1. Start with the entire set of objects and find the set of attributes common to all of them.
2. For each subset of objects, find the set of attributes common to all objects in the subset.
3. Ensure that the subset of objects is maximal with respect to the set of attributes, and vice versa.

Let's identify the concepts step-by-step:

1. Concept 1: ( {}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} )
   - This is the top concept, where no objects have all attributes.

2. Concept 2: ( {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}, {} )
   - This is the bottom concept, where all objects have no common attributes.

3. Concept 3: ( {o1, o3}, {a1, a4} )
   - Objects o1 and o3 share attributes a1 and a4.

4. Concept 4: ( {o3, o4, o5}, {a2} )
   - Objects o3, o4, and o5 share attribute a2.

5. Concept 5: ( {o1, o2}, {a3} )
   - Objects o1 and o2 share attribute a3.

6. Concept 6: ( {o3}, {a1, a2, a4, a5} )
   - Object o3 has attributes a1, a2, a4, and a5.

7. Concept 7: ( {o4}, {a2, a5} )
   - Object o4 has attributes a2 and a5.

8. Concept 8: ( {o5}, {a2} )
   - Object o5 has attribute a2.

9. Concept 9: ( {o1}, {a1, a3, a4} )
   - Object o1 has attributes a1, a3, and a4.

10. Concept 10: ( {o2}, {a3} )
    - Object o2 has attribute a3.

These are the formal concepts derived from the given context. Each concept is a maximal pair of objects and attributes that satisfy the conditions of FCA.

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
