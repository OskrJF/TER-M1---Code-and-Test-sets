Prompt:


PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:
Sure, I can help with that. In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a formal context is typically represented as a table where rows represent objects and columns represent attributes. A lattice concept is a pair of sets (A, B), where A is a set of attributes and B is a set of objects, such that A is the maximal set of attributes common to all objects in B, and B is the maximal set of objects sharing all attributes in A.

Please provide the .csv file so I can process it and extract the lattice concepts.

Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

Please provide the .csv file so I can process it and extract the lattice concepts in the requested format.

o1,yes,yes,no
o2,no,yes,yes

The lattice concepts extracted from the provided context are:

[[[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]]]
