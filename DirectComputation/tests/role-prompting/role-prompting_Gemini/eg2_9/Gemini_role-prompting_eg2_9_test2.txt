PROMPT 1:
I want you to act as a computer science teacher who's explaining to their students. In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
Okay class, today we're going to dive into an interesting topic in **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**. We'll be looking at how to extract **formal concepts** from a given dataset. I have a small CSV file here that represents our 'formal context'.

Let's look at the content of this file:

```csv
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9
o1;yes;yes;yes;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes
o2;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes
```

This table shows us two **objects** (o1, o2) and nine **attributes** (a1 through a9)[cite: 1]. The 'yes' indicates that an object possesses an attribute, and 'no' indicates it doesn't[cite: 1].

## What is a Formal Concept?

In FCA, a **formal concept** is a pair `(A, B)` where:
* `A` is a set of **objects** (called the **extent**).
* `B` is a set of **attributes** (called the **intent**).

The crucial idea is that:
1.  All objects in `A` share *all* attributes in `B`.
2.  There is no object *outside* of `A` that shares *all* attributes in `B`.
3.  There is no attribute *outside* of `B` that is shared by *all* objects in `A`.

Think of it as a maximal rectangle of 'yes' entries in our table, once we reorder rows and columns.

## Let's Identify the Concepts! üßê

We'll systematically find these concepts. Let's denote the set of all objects as $G = \{o1, o2\}$ and the set of all attributes as $M = \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\}$.

First, let's list the attributes for each object based on the CSV data[cite: 1]:
* **o1**: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
* **o2**: {a1, a4, a6, a9}

Now, we'll find the concepts:

1.  **The Bottom Concept (Extent: All Objects)**:
    * **Extent**: {o1, o2}
    * **Intent**: What attributes are common to both o1 and o2?
        * o1: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
        * o2: {a1, a4, a6, a9}
        * Common: {a1, a4, a9}
    * So, **Concept 1**: `({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})`

2.  **Concepts derived from individual objects**:

    * **Starting with o1**:
        * Object set: {o1}
        * Attributes of o1: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9} [cite: 1]
        * Are there any other objects that have *all* these attributes? No, o2 does not have a2, a3, or a7[cite: 1].
        * So, **Concept 2**: `({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})`

    * **Starting with o2**:
        * Object set: {o2}
        * Attributes of o2: {a1, a4, a6, a9} [cite: 1]
        * Are there any other objects that have *all* these attributes? No, o1 does not have a6[cite: 1].
        * So, **Concept 3**: `({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})`

3.  **The Top Concept (Intent: All Attributes shared by no specific subset, or context-dependent, often an empty set of objects if no attribute is shared by all, or all objects if all attributes are shared by some)**:
    Let's re-evaluate from the perspective of the "fullest possible intent". However, in practice, the "top" concept usually refers to the pair (all objects that have *all* attributes, all attributes) or (objects sharing no attributes, all attributes) OR (all objects, attributes shared by all objects). The clearest "top" concept in many representations is (Objects that possess *all* listed attributes, All attributes). In our case, no single object possesses all attributes a1 through a9.

    A more standard definition for the top concept in a lattice is `(G, G')` where G is the set of all objects and G' is the set of attributes common to all objects in G. This is what we found as Concept 1.
    The dual notion, often called the "bottom concept" in some contexts (or "top" if you invert the lattice diagram), is `(M', M)` where M is the set of all attributes and M' is the set of objects that possess all attributes in M.
    * If we consider the set of *all* attributes $M = \{a1, ..., a9\}$, which objects possess all of them? None.
        * Extent: $\emptyset$ (empty set of objects)
        * Intent: $\{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\}$ (all attributes)
    * So, **Concept 4**: `($\emptyset$, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})`
        *(This concept represents the idea that no object has all attributes. It's formally correct but sometimes omitted in simpler enumerations if it doesn't provide practical insight for the specific application).*

    However, it's more common to define the "top" concept as having an empty *intent* if no attributes are common to all objects, and the "bottom" concept as having an empty *extent* if no object possesses all attributes.
    Let's refine the "Top/Bottom" understanding for clarity in typical FCA lattice diagrams:
    * **The actual "Top" Concept (Widest Extent)**: This is `({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})`, which we already found (Concept 1). It has the largest set of objects.
    * **The actual "Bottom" Concept (Widest Intent)**: This is `($\emptyset$, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})` (Concept 4). It has the largest set of attributes (meaning no objects share them all).

Are there any other combinations?
If we take an attribute set like `{a1}`, the objects are `{o1, o2}`. Their common attributes are `{a1, a4, a9}`. This brings us back to Concept 1.
If we take `{a2}`, the objects are `{o1}`. Their common attributes are `{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}`. This brings us back to Concept 2.

It appears we have found all concepts for this small context.

## Enumerated Formal Concepts üìù

Let's list them clearly:

1.  **C1**: `({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})`
    * Objects {o1, o2} commonly share attributes {a1, a4, a9}[cite: 1].
2.  **C2**: `({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})`
    * Object {o1} has attributes {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}[cite: 1]. No other object has this exact full set of attributes.
3.  **C3**: `({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})`
    * Object {o2} has attributes {a1, a4, a6, a9}[cite: 1]. No other object has this exact full set of attributes.
4.  **C4**: `($\emptyset$, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})`
    * No object possesses all attributes from a1 to a9.

These four pairs are the formal concepts for the provided context. When we draw a concept lattice, these would be the nodes in our diagram! The relationships between them (which concept is a sub-concept or super-concept of another) would define the edges of the lattice.

Any questions? This process can be done by algorithms for larger datasets, but for a small one like this, we can often work it out by careful inspection.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can format the list of concepts as you requested.

Based on the concepts we identified:
1.  Extent: `{o1, o2}`, Intent: `{a1, a4, a9}`
2.  Extent: `{o1}`, Intent: `{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}`
3.  Extent: `{o2}`, Intent: `{a1, a4, a6, a9}`
4.  Extent: `$\emptyset$` (empty set), Intent: `{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}`

Here they are in the specified single-line format `[[intent_attributes], [extent_objects]]`:

```
[[[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []]]
