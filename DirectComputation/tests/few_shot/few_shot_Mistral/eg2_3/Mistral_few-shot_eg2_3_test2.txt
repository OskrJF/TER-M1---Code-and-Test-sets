PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts:
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

EXAMPLE:
For the next context
;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9;a10;a11;a12;a13;a14;a15;a16
o1;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no
o2;yes;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no;no;yes;yes;yes;no;no
o3;no;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;yes;yes;no;yes;no;no;no;no

the list of lattice concepts is the next
[[[a9], [o1, o2, o3]], [[a1, a3, a5, a8, a9, a12, a13, a14], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16], []], [[a2, a5, a7, a9, a10, a12], [o3]], [[a5, a9, a12], [o2, o3]], [[a9, a11, a14, a15], [o1]], [[a9, a14], [o1, o2]]]

OUTPUT:
To extract and enumerate all lattice concepts from the given context in formal concept analysis (FCA), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the objects and attributes**: In the given context, the objects are `o1` and `o2`, and the attributes are `a1`, `a2`, and `a3`.

2. **Create the formal context**: This is a table where rows represent objects and columns represent attributes. A cell contains "yes" if the object has the attribute, and "no" otherwise.

   |   | a1 | a2 | a3 |
   |---|----|----|----|
   |o1 | yes| yes| no |
   |o2 | no | yes| yes|

3. **Find all possible combinations of attributes and objects**: We need to find all pairs of sets of attributes and sets of objects such that every object in the set has all the attributes in the set, and every attribute in the set is shared by all the objects in the set.

4. **Enumerate the concepts**: A concept is a pair `(A, B)`, where `A` is a set of attributes and `B` is a set of objects.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

- **Concept 1**: The empty set of attributes and all objects.
  - Attributes: `[]`
  - Objects: `[o1, o2]`

- **Concept 2**: The set of all attributes and the empty set of objects.
  - Attributes: `[a1, a2, a3]`
  - Objects: `[]`

- **Concept 3**: The attribute `a2` is shared by both objects `o1` and `o2`.
  - Attributes: `[a2]`
  - Objects: `[o1, o2]`

- **Concept 4**: The attributes `a1` and `a2` are shared by object `o1`.
  - Attributes: `[a1, a2]`
  - Objects: `[o1]`

- **Concept 5**: The attributes `a2` and `a3` are shared by object `o2`.
  - Attributes: `[a2, a3]`
  - Objects: `[o2]`

So, the list of lattice concepts for the given context is:

```python
[
    [[], [o1, o2]],
    [[a2], [o1, o2]],
    [[a1, a2], [o1]],
    [[a2, a3], [o2]],
    [[a1, a2, a3], []]
]
```

This list represents all the formal concepts derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Certainly! Here is the list of all concepts in a single line with the specified format:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
