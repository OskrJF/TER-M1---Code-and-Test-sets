PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

EXAMPLE:
For the next context
;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9;a10;a11;a12;a13;a14;a15;a16
o1;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no
o2;yes;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no;no;yes;yes;yes;no;no
o3;no;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;yes;yes;no;yes;no;no;no;no

the list of lattice concepts is the next
[[[a9], [o1, o2, o3]], [[a1, a3, a5, a8, a9, a12, a13, a14], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16], []], [[a2, a5, a7, a9, a10, a12], [o3]], [[a5, a9, a12], [o2, o3]], [[a9, a11, a14, a15], [o1]], [[a9, a14], [o1, o2]]]

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze the given CSV file to extract all lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Let me first read and process the data, then compute the concepts.

The tool above processes your CSV file and extracts all lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis. Here's what it does:

1. **Parses the CSV data** with objects (o1-o5) and attributes (a1-a5)
2. **Creates a formal context** where "yes" = true and "no" = false
3. **Computes all formal concepts** using the closure operators:
   - Intent: attributes shared by all objects in the extent
   - Extent: objects that have all attributes in the intent
4. **Validates concepts** using the Galois connection property
5. **Displays results** in multiple formats

The algorithm systematically generates all possible object subsets, computes their corresponding attribute closures (intents), then verifies that each forms a valid formal concept by checking the bidirectional closure property.

For your specific context with 5 objects and 5 attributes, the tool will identify all maximal rectangles of "yes" values in the binary relation matrix, which correspond to the formal concepts in the concept lattice.

The final output shows each concept as `[[intent], [extent]]` following your requested format, where the intent contains the attributes and the extent contains the objects that form each concept.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
The analysis tool has been updated to display the lattice concepts in the exact format you requested. It will now show all concepts in a single line format like `[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3]], ...]` without any quotation marks.

The tool processes your CSV data systematically:
- Objects: o1, o2, o3, o4, o5  
- Attributes: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5
- Binary relation: "yes" values indicate which objects have which attributes

Each formal concept consists of a maximal set of objects (extent) that share a maximal set of attributes (intent), satisfying the Galois connection property of Formal Concept Analysis.

[[[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
