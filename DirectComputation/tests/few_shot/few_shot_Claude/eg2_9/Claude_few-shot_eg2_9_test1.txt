PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

EXAMPLE:
For the next context
;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9;a10;a11;a12;a13;a14;a15;a16
o1;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no
o2;yes;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes;yes;no;no;yes;yes;yes;no;no
o3;no;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;yes;yes;no;yes;no;no;no;no

the list of lattice concepts is the next
[[[a9], [o1, o2, o3]], [[a1, a3, a5, a8, a9, a12, a13, a14], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16], []], [[a2, a5, a7, a9, a10, a12], [o3]], [[a5, a9, a12], [o2, o3]], [[a9, a11, a14, a15], [o1]], [[a9, a14], [o1, o2]]]

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze the CSV file to extract all lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis principles. Let me first read and process the data, then compute the concepts.

I've created a comprehensive FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) tool that processes your CSV file and extracts all lattice concepts. The tool:

1. **Reads and parses** your CSV file with semicolon delimiters
2. **Displays the context table** showing the formal context with objects (o1, o2) and attributes (a1-a9)
3. **Implements the FCA algorithm** to find all formal concepts by:
   - Generating all possible attribute subsets
   - Computing extents (objects sharing attributes) and intents (attributes shared by objects)
   - Identifying closed concepts where extent' = intent and intent' = extent
4. **Presents results** in both detailed format and the JSON array format you requested

The algorithm systematically finds all concept pairs (Intent, Extent) where:
- **Intent**: Set of attributes shared by all objects in the extent
- **Extent**: Set of objects that have all attributes in the intent

Based on your CSV data with objects o1 and o2 and their yes/no relationships to attributes a1-a9, the tool will identify all valid lattice concepts and display them in the format you specified: `[[[attributes], [objects]], ...]`

The interface provides a clear visualization of both the original context and the extracted formal concepts, making it easy to understand the lattice structure of your data.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! I've updated the tool to display the lattice concepts in the exact single-line format you requested, without any quotation marks. The tool now prominently shows the result in the format:

`[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1, o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]]`

The updated interface displays:
1. **Single Line Format (No Quotes)** - prominently highlighted at the top
2. **Detailed Concepts** - showing the breakdown of each concept
3. **Standard JSON Format** - for reference

Run the tool and you'll get the complete list of all lattice concepts from your CSV data in one clean line, formatted exactly as you specified.

[[[a1,a4,a9], [o1,o2]], [[a1,a4,a6,a9], [o2]], [[a1,a2,a3,a4,a7,a9], [o1]], [[a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9], []]]
