PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given thenext context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes
____________________

OUTPUT:
To extract all **formal concepts** (also known as lattice concepts) from a **formal context** in **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**, we follow these steps:

---

### **1. Given Formal Context:**

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| o1     | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | yes | yes |

We'll interpret this as a formal context:

* **G** (Objects) = {o1, o2}
* **M** (Attributes) = {a1, a2, a3}
* **I** (Incidence relation):

  * o1 has attributes: a1, a2
  * o2 has attributes: a2, a3

---

### **2. Definitions:**

A **formal concept** is a pair (A, B) where:

* A ⊆ G is the **extent** (set of objects)
* B ⊆ M is the **intent** (set of attributes)
* A' = B and B' = A, where:

  * A' = {attributes common to all objects in A}
  * B' = {objects that have all attributes in B}

---

### **3. List All Extents and Compute Intents:**

We'll examine all subsets of G:

#### **Extent: ∅ (empty set)**

* A' = all attributes = {a1, a2, a3} (by definition)
* B' = objects with all 3 attributes = ∅
* ⇒ Concept: **(∅, {a1, a2, a3})**

---

#### **Extent: {o1}**

* A' = attributes of o1 = {a1, a2}
* B' = objects with both a1 and a2 = {o1}
* ⇒ Concept: **({o1}, {a1, a2})**

---

#### **Extent: {o2}**

* A' = attributes of o2 = {a2, a3}
* B' = objects with both a2 and a3 = {o2}
* ⇒ Concept: **({o2}, {a2, a3})**

---

#### **Extent: {o1, o2}**

* A' = attributes common to o1 and o2 = {a2}
* B' = objects with a2 = {o1, o2}
* ⇒ Concept: **({o1, o2}, {a2})**

---

### **4. List All Concepts**

Here are all formal concepts:

1. **(∅, {a1, a2, a3})** — bottom concept
2. **({o1}, {a1, a2})**
3. **({o2}, {a2, a3})**
4. **({o1, o2}, {a2})** — top concept

---

### ✅ Summary

The **formal concepts** in this context are:

1. (∅, {a1, a2, a3})
2. ({o1}, {a1, a2})
3. ({o2}, {a2, a3})
4. ({o1, o2}, {a2})

Would you like me to draw the **concept lattice diagram** based on this?

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Sure! Here's the list of all formal concepts in the requested format:

```
[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
```
