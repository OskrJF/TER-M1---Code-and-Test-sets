PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given the next context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5
o1;yes;no;yes;yes;no
o2;no;no;yes;no;no
o3;yes;yes;no;yes;yes
o4;no;yes;no;no;yes
o5;no;yes;no;no;no

OUTPUT:
To extract all **formal concepts** (also called **lattice concepts**) from a Formal Context in **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**, we need to:

### Definitions

Given a formal context $(G, M, I)$, where:

* $G$ is the set of objects: {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
* $M$ is the set of attributes: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}
* $I \subseteq G \times M$ is the incidence relation (object has attribute)

A **formal concept** is a pair $(A, B)$, where:

* $A \subseteq G$ is the **extent** (objects)
* $B \subseteq M$ is the **intent** (attributes)
* Such that:

  * $A' = B$: all attributes shared by every object in $A$
  * $B' = A$: all objects having all attributes in $B$

### Step 1: Convert the context to a binary table:

|        | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **o1** | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| **o2** | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
| **o3** | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
| **o4** | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  |
| **o5** | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |

### Step 2: Generate all formal concepts

We’ll follow the **Next Closure algorithm** or concept lattice construction ideas. Here's the result after systematically computing all formal concepts:

### ✅ **All Formal Concepts (Extent, Intent)**

#### Concept 1:

* Extent: {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
* Intent: {}

#### Concept 2:

* Extent: {o3, o4, o5}
* Intent: {a2}

#### Concept 3:

* Extent: {o3, o4}
* Intent: {a2, a5}

#### Concept 4:

* Extent: {o3}
* Intent: {a1, a2, a4, a5}

#### Concept 5:

* Extent: {o4}
* Intent: {a2, a5}

#### Concept 6:

* Extent: {o5}
* Intent: {a2}

#### Concept 7:

* Extent: {o1, o2}
* Intent: {a3}

#### Concept 8:

* Extent: {o1}
* Intent: {a1, a3, a4}

#### Concept 9:

* Extent: {o2}
* Intent: {a3}

#### Concept 10:

* Extent: ∅
* Intent: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}

### ✅ Summary

There are **10 formal concepts** in this context. These concepts can be used to draw the **concept lattice** where each concept is a node, and edges represent the order by inclusion of extents (or reverse inclusion of intents).

Let me know if you'd like a **Hasse diagram** or the **Next Closure algorithm steps**!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here is the list of all formal concepts in the requested format:

```
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
