PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
Based on the provided CSV file[cite: 1], which defines a formal context, the following formal concepts have been extracted. Each concept is a pair (A, B), where A is a set of **objects** (extent) and B is a set of **attributes** (intent). The intent B consists of all attributes shared by all objects in A, and the extent A consists of all objects that possess all attributes in B.

The formal context is derived as follows:
Objects: O = {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
Attributes: M = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}

The relationships (object possesses attribute) are[cite: 1]:
* **o1**: {a1, a3, a4}
* **o2**: {a3}
* **o3**: {a1, a2, a4, a5}
* **o4**: {a2, a5}
* **o5**: {a2}

## Enumerated Lattice Concepts

Here are the 8 formal concepts extracted from the given context:

1.  **Concept 1 (Bottom Concept)**
    * Extent (Objects): {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
    * Intent (Attributes): ∅
    * *Interpretation*: All objects share no common attributes.

2.  **Concept 2**
    * Extent (Objects): {o1, o2}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a3}
    * *Interpretation*: Objects o1 and o2 (and only these) share the attribute a3 (and potentially others, but {a3} is the maximal set of attributes common to precisely {o1,o2} after closure).

3.  **Concept 3**
    * Extent (Objects): {o1, o3}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a1, a4}
    * *Interpretation*: Objects o1 and o3 share attributes a1 and a4.

4.  **Concept 4**
    * Extent (Objects): {o1}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a1, a3, a4}
    * *Interpretation*: Object o1 possesses attributes a1, a3, and a4.

5.  **Concept 5**
    * Extent (Objects): {o3, o4, o5}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a2}
    * *Interpretation*: Objects o3, o4, and o5 share attribute a2.

6.  **Concept 6**
    * Extent (Objects): {o3, o4}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a2, a5}
    * *Interpretation*: Objects o3 and o4 share attributes a2 and a5.

7.  **Concept 7**
    * Extent (Objects): {o3}
    * Intent (Attributes): {a1, a2, a4, a5}
    * *Interpretation*: Object o3 possesses attributes a1, a2, a4, and a5.

8.  **Concept 8 (Top Concept)**
    * Extent (Objects): ∅
    * Intent (Attributes): {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}
    * *Interpretation*: No object possesses all attributes. (Or, the set of attributes common to an empty set of objects is the set of all attributes).

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
