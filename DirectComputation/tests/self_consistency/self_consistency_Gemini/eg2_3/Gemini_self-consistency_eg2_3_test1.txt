PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
Based on the provided CSV file[cite: 1], which describes a formal context, here are the extracted formal concepts:

The formal context is defined by:
* **Objects (G):** {o1, o2}
* **Attributes (M):** {a1, a2, a3}
* **Incidence Relation (I):**
    * o1 possesses attributes a1, a2 [cite: 1]
    * o2 possesses attributes a2, a3 [cite: 1]

A formal concept is a pair (A, B), where A is a set of objects (the **extent**) and B is a set of attributes (the **intent**) such that:
1.  A' = B (all objects in A share all attributes in B, and B contains all attributes shared by objects in A)
2.  B' = A (all attributes in B are possessed by all objects in A, and A contains all objects that possess all attributes in B)

The enumerated formal concepts are:

1.  **Concept 1 (Bottom Concept):**
    * **Extent (Objects):** âˆ… (empty set)
    * **Intent (Attributes):** {a1, a2, a3}
    * *Explanation:* No objects possess all attributes {a1, a2, a3} simultaneously. The set of attributes common to an empty set of objects is, by definition, all attributes.

2.  **Concept 2:**
    * **Extent (Objects):** {o1}
    * **Intent (Attributes):** {a1, a2}
    * *Explanation:* Object o1 possesses attributes a1 and a2[cite: 1]. No other object possesses both a1 and a2 (o2 does not possess a1 [cite: 1]).

3.  **Concept 3:**
    * **Extent (Objects):** {o2}
    * **Intent (Attributes):** {a2, a3}
    * *Explanation:* Object o2 possesses attributes a2 and a3[cite: 1]. No other object possesses both a2 and a3 (o1 does not possess a3 [cite: 1]).

4.  **Concept 4 (Top Concept):**
    * **Extent (Objects):** {o1, o2}
    * **Intent (Attributes):** {a2}
    * *Explanation:* Objects o1 and o2 both possess attribute a2[cite: 1]. Attribute a2 is the only attribute common to both o1 and o2.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
[[[a1,a2,a3],[]],[[a1,a2],[o1]],[[a2,a3],[o2]],[[a2],[o1,o2]]]
