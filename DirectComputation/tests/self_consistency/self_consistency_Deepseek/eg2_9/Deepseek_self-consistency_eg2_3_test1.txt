PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

OUTPUT:
In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a formal concept is a pair \((A, B)\) where:
- \(A\) is a set of objects (extent),
- \(B\) is a set of attributes (intent),
- and every object in \(A\) has all attributes in \(B\), and every attribute in \(B\) is shared by all objects in \(A\).

Given the context from the CSV file:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 | a6 | a7 | a8 | a9 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| yes| yes| no | no | yes| no | yes|
| o2    | yes| no | no | yes| no | yes| no | no | yes|

### Step 1: List all objects and attributes
- Objects: \( \{o1, o2\} \)
- Attributes: \( \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\} \)

### Step 2: Compute all formal concepts
We generate all possible combinations of objects and compute their shared attributes, then verify if the pair \((A, B)\) is a formal concept.

1. **Concept 1**: \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\})\)  
   - Extent: Empty set (no objects).  
   - Intent: All attributes (trivially satisfied).  

2. **Concept 2**: \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\})\)  
   - Attributes shared by \(o1\): \(a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\).  

3. **Concept 3**: \((\{o2\}, \{a1, a4, a6, a9\})\)  
   - Attributes shared by \(o2\): \(a1, a4, a6, a9\).  

4. **Concept 4**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})\)  
   - Attributes shared by both \(o1\) and \(o2\): \(a1, a4, a9\).  

### Step 3: Verify no other concepts exist
- No other combinations of objects or attributes satisfy the formal concept definition. For example:
  - \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})\) is already the maximal shared intent for the extent \(\{o1, o2\}\).
  - No smaller subsets of attributes are shared by larger extents beyond the ones listed.

### Final List of All Formal Concepts:
1. \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\})\)  
2. \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\})\)  
3. \((\{o2\}, \{a1, a4, a6, a9\})\)  
4. \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})\)  

These are all the formal concepts for the given context. The corresponding concept lattice can be constructed by ordering these concepts by subset inclusion of extents (or superset inclusion of intents).

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]
