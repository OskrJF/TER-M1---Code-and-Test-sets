PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

OUTPUT:
In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a formal concept is a pair \((A, B)\) where \(A\) is a set of objects (extent) and \(B\) is a set of attributes (intent) such that every object in \(A\) has all attributes in \(B\), and every attribute in \(B\) is shared by all objects in \(A\). 

Given the context from the file `eg2_3.csv`, let's extract and enumerate all formal concepts.

### Context:
| Objet | a1  | a2  | a3  |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| o1    | yes | yes | no  |
| o2    | no  | yes | yes |

### Step 1: List all objects and attributes
- **Objects**: \( \{o1, o2\} \)
- **Attributes**: \( \{a1, a2, a3\} \)

### Step 2: Compute all formal concepts
We can find all concepts by considering all possible combinations of objects and their common attributes, or attributes and their shared objects.

1. **Concept 1**: \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})\)  
   - **Extent**: No objects, so all attributes are included by default.  
   - **Intent**: \(\{a1, a2, a3\}\)

2. **Concept 2**: \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)  
   - **Extent**: \(o1\) has attributes \(a1\) and \(a2\).  
   - **Intent**: \(\{a1, a2\}\)

3. **Concept 3**: \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)  
   - **Extent**: \(o2\) has attributes \(a2\) and \(a3\).  
   - **Intent**: \(\{a2, a3\}\)

4. **Concept 4**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)  
   - **Extent**: Both \(o1\) and \(o2\) share attribute \(a2\).  
   - **Intent**: \(\{a2\}\)

### Step 3: Verify no other concepts exist
- No other combinations of objects share additional common attributes beyond the ones listed above. For example:
  - \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\) is already covered.
  - No single attribute is shared by all objects except \(a2\).

### Final List of Formal Concepts:
1. \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})\)  
2. \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)  
3. \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)  
4. \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)  

These are all the formal concepts for the given context. The corresponding concept lattice can be visualized as a hierarchy where:
- The top concept is \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})\).
- The bottom concept is \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\).
- The intermediate concepts are \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\) and \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\). 

The lattice structure would show that \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\) and \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\) are both sub-concepts of \((\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})\) and super-concepts of \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\).

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
