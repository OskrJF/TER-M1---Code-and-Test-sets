PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given the next context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9
o1;yes;yes;yes;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes
o2;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes

OUTPUT:
To extract and enumerate all lattice concepts in the given formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Objects and Attributes:**
   - Objects: \( o1, o2 \)
   - Attributes: \( a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9 \)

2. **Create the Formal Context Table:**
   The table is already provided, where "yes" indicates that an object has an attribute, and "no" indicates it does not.

3. **Find Formal Concepts:**
   A formal concept is a pair \((A, B)\), where \(A\) is a set of objects, \(B\) is a set of attributes, \(A' = B\), and \(B' = A\). \(A'\) is the set of attributes common to all objects in \(A\), and \(B'\) is the set of objects that have all attributes in \(B\).

4. **Enumerate All Concepts:**
   We will find all possible pairs \((A, B)\) that satisfy the above conditions.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

- **Concept 1:**
  - \(A = \{o1, o2\}\)
  - \(B = \{a1, a4, a9\}\) (attributes common to both \(o1\) and \(o2\))

- **Concept 2:**
  - \(A = \{o1\}\)
  - \(B = \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\}\) (attributes of \(o1\))

- **Concept 3:**
  - \(A = \{o2\}\)
  - \(B = \{a1, a4, a6, a9\}\) (attributes of \(o2\))

- **Concept 4:**
  - \(A = \{\}\)
  - \(B = \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\}\) (all attributes)

- **Concept 5:**
  - \(A = \{o1, o2\}\)
  - \(B = \{\}\) (no common attributes)

These are the formal concepts derived from the given context. Each concept is a maximal rectangle of "yes" entries in the context table.

Here is the enumeration of all lattice concepts:

| Concept | Objects (A) | Attributes (B)                     |
|---------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| 1       | {o1, o2}    | {a1, a4, a9}                       |
| 2       | {o1}        | {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}           |
| 3       | {o2}        | {a1, a4, a6, a9}                   |
| 4       | {}          | {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9} |
| 5       | {o1, o2}    | {}                                 |

These concepts form the concept lattice for the given formal context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[], [o1, o2]]]
