PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given the next context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5
o1;yes;no;yes;yes;no
o2;no;no;yes;no;no
o3;yes;yes;no;yes;yes
o4;no;yes;no;no;yes
o5;no;yes;no;no;no

OUTPUT:
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a method used to analyze data and identify conceptual structures within it. The data is typically represented as a formal context, which is a triplet (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes, and I is a binary relation between G and M.

Given your context, we can represent it as follows:

- Objects (G): {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}
- Attributes (M): {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}

The relation I is given by the table you provided, where "yes" indicates that an object has an attribute, and "no" indicates that it does not.

To extract all formal concepts, we need to find all pairs (A, B) where A is a subset of G, B is a subset of M, and A' = B and B' = A. Here, A' is the set of attributes common to all objects in A, and B' is the set of objects that have all attributes in B.

Let's compute the formal concepts step by step.It seems there was an error in the code due to incorrect usage of the `set.intersection` method. Let's fix that and try again to extract the formal concepts from the given context.Here are the formal concepts extracted from the given context in the field of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA):

| Objects | Attributes |
|---------|------------|
| {o1, o3} | {a1, a4} |
| {} | {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5} |
| {o3, o4} | {a2, a5} |
| {o1, o2} | {a3} |
| {o3, o4, o5} | {a2} |
| {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5} | {} |
| {o1} | {a1, a3, a4} |
| {o3} | {a1, a2, a4, a5} |

These pairs represent the formal concepts derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]]]
