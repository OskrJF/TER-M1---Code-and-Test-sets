OUTPUT:
In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a formal context is typically represented as a triplet \((G, M, I)\), where \(G\) is a set of objects, \(M\) is a set of attributes, and \(I\) is a binary relation between \(G\) and \(M\). The relation \(I\) indicates which objects have which attributes.

Given your context:

- Objects \(G = \{o1, o2\}\)
- Attributes \(M = \{a1, a2, a3\}\)

The relation \(I\) can be represented as follows:

- \(o1\) has attributes \(a1\) and \(a2\)
- \(o2\) has attributes \(a2\) and \(a3\)

To find the formal concepts, we need to determine all pairs \((A, B)\) where \(A \subseteq G\), \(B \subseteq M\), and \((A, B)\) forms a concept. A concept is defined such that \(A' = B\) and \(B' = A\), where \('\) denotes the derivation operator.

Let's enumerate all possible concepts:

1. **Concept 1**: \((\emptyset, \{a1, a2, a3\})\)
   - This is the top concept where no objects have all attributes.

2. **Concept 2**: \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)
   - Object \(o1\) has attributes \(a1\) and \(a2\).

3. **Concept 3**: \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)
   - Object \(o2\) has attributes \(a2\) and \(a3\).

4. **Concept 4**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)
   - Both objects \(o1\) and \(o2\) share attribute \(a2\).

5. **Concept 5**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \emptyset)\)
   - This is the bottom concept where all objects have no attributes in common.

These are the formal concepts derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[], [o1, o2]]]
