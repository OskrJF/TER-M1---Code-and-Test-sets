PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given thenext context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

OUTPUT:
In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a formal context is a triplet \((G, M, I)\), where \(G\) is a set of objects, \(M\) is a set of attributes, and \(I\) is a binary relation between \(G\) and \(M\). The relation \(I\) indicates which objects have which attributes.

Given your context:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| no |
| o2    | no | yes| yes|

We can interpret this as:

- Objects \(G = \{o1, o2\}\)
- Attributes \(M = \{a1, a2, a3\}\)
- Relation \(I\) is defined by the table.

A formal concept is a pair \((A, B)\), where \(A \subseteq G\), \(B \subseteq M\), such that \(A' = B\) and \(B' = A\). Here, \(A'\) is the set of attributes common to all objects in \(A\), and \(B'\) is the set of objects that have all attributes in \(B\).

Let's enumerate all the concepts in the lattice:

1. \((\emptyset, \{a1, a2, a3\})\)
2. \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)
3. \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)
4. \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)
5. \((\{o1\}, \{a1\})\)
6. \((\{o2\}, \{a3\})\)
7. \((\emptyset, \emptyset)\)

These are the formal concepts derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
