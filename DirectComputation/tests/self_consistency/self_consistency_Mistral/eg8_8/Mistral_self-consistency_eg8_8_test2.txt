OUTPUT:
To extract and enumerate all lattice concepts in the field of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the Formal Context**: This is a triplet \((G, M, I)\), where \(G\) is a set of objects, \(M\) is a set of attributes, and \(I\) is a binary relation between \(G\) and \(M\).

2. **Identify Concepts**: A concept is a pair \((A, B)\), where \(A \subseteq G\), \(B \subseteq M\), \(A' = B\), and \(B' = A\). Here, \(A'\) is the set of attributes common to all objects in \(A\), and \(B'\) is the set of objects that have all attributes in \(B\).

3. **Compute the Concept Lattice**: This involves finding all concepts and ordering them based on the subset relation.

Let's start by defining the formal context and then proceed to compute the concepts and the lattice.In the given formal context, the only lattice concept extracted is:

| Objects | Attributes |
|---------|------------|
| O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, O8 | a2 |

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a2], [O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, O8]]]
