PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze this formal concept context and extract all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

I've created a comprehensive Formal Concept Analysis tool that extracts and enumerates all lattice concepts from your CSV file. Here's what the analysis reveals:

**The formal context contains:**
- 5 objects: o1, o2, o3, o4, o5
- 5 attributes: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5

**Key findings from the lattice concept extraction:**

The tool systematically computes all formal concepts by:
1. Generating all possible object subsets
2. Computing their common attributes (intent)
3. Finding all objects that share those attributes (extent)
4. Verifying the closure properties that define formal concepts

Each formal concept is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is the extent (set of objects)
- B is the intent (set of attributes)
- A = {objects that have all attributes in B}
- B = {attributes shared by all objects in A}

The visualization shows the binary incidence matrix with crosses (Ã—) marking where objects have specific attributes, making it easy to trace the concept formation process.

The analysis provides complete enumeration of all concepts in the concept lattice, which forms the mathematical foundation for knowledge representation and data analysis in FCA. Each concept represents a maximal rectangle of crosses in the formal context when rows and columns are appropriately ordered.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Looking at the formal context, I need to systematically extract all formal concepts. Let me compute this step by step:

From the CSV data:
- o1: a1, a3, a4
- o2: a3
- o3: a1, a2, a4, a5
- o4: a2, a5
- o5: a2

Computing all formal concepts (extent, intent pairs):

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1, o3]], [[a4], [o1, o3]], [[a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]]]
