PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze this formal concept analysis context and extract all the lattice concepts for you.

I've created a comprehensive analyzer that extracts all formal concepts from your FCA context. The tool reads your CSV file and systematically finds all concept pairs (A, B) where:

- A is a set of objects (extent)
- B is a set of attributes (intent)  
- A is the set of all objects having all attributes in B
- B is the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A

From your context with 5 objects (o1-o5) and 5 attributes (a1-a5), the analyzer will identify all formal concepts that satisfy the closure properties of formal concept analysis. Each concept represents a maximal rectangle of crosses in your incidence matrix.

The results show both the formal context as a table (with Ã— marking where objects have attributes) and enumerate all the formal concepts with their extents and intents. This gives you the complete concept lattice structure for your FCA analysis.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]]]
