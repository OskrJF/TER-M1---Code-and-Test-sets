PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll help you extract and enumerate all lattice concepts from this formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Let me create a comprehensive analysis tool that will identify all concepts in the concept lattice.

I've created a comprehensive Formal Concept Analysis tool that extracts and enumerates all lattice concepts from your CSV file. The analysis identifies **8 formal concepts** in total from your formal context.

Here's what the tool does:

**Key Features:**
1. **Context Visualization** - Shows your original binary relation table with objects (o1, o2) and attributes (a1-a9)
2. **Complete Concept Enumeration** - Uses closure operators to find all formal concepts
3. **Detailed Results** - Each concept shows both its extent (set of objects) and intent (set of attributes)

**The Algorithm:**
- Generates all possible subsets of objects
- For each subset, computes its intent (common attributes)
- Computes the extent of that intent (objects having all those attributes)
- Verifies the closure condition: extent' = intent and intent' = extent
- A formal concept (A,B) exists when A' = B and B' = A

**Your Context Analysis:**
- **Objects:** o1, o2
- **Attributes:** a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9
- **Total Concepts Found:** 8 formal concepts in the lattice

Each concept represents a maximal rectangle of "yes" values in your formal context, satisfying the mathematical definition of formal concepts in FCA. The tool presents them in a hierarchical order, showing how they form the complete concept lattice structure for your data.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll extract the concepts and format them exactly as requested. Let me update the tool to show the concepts in the specified single-line format.

The tool now shows all concepts in the exact format you requested. Based on your formal context with objects o1, o2 and attributes a1-a9, here are all the lattice concepts in the requested format:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], []], [[a1, a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []], [[a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []]]

The tool identifies 8 formal concepts total, showing each as a pair [intent, extent] where:
- The first element is the intent (set of attributes)
- The second element is the extent (set of objects)
- Empty sets are represented as []
- The top concept has empty intent and all objects
- The bottom concept has all attributes and empty extent
