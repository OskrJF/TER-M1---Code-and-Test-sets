PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze your CSV file using formal concept analysis to extract all lattice concepts. Let me first read and process the data, then compute the formal concepts.

The analysis shows your formal context and extracts all lattice concepts. In formal concept analysis, a **formal concept** is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is a set of objects (extent)
- B is a set of attributes (intent)
- A is the set of all objects that have all attributes in B
- B is the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A

From your context with objects {o1, o2} and attributes {a1, a2, a3}, the complete lattice contains **5 formal concepts**:

1. **Top concept**: ({}, {a1, a2, a3}) - No objects share all attributes
2. **({o1}, {a1, a2})** - Object o1 has attributes a1 and a2
3. **({o2}, {a2, a3})** - Object o2 has attributes a2 and a3  
4. **({o1, o2}, {a2})** - Both objects share attribute a2
5. **Bottom concept**: ({o1, o2}, {}) - All objects with no common attributes

These concepts form a complete lattice ordered by inclusion of extents (equivalently, reverse inclusion of intents). The lattice structure represents all possible ways to group objects by their shared attributes in your formal context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[], [o1, o2]]]
