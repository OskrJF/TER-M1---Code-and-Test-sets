PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze your CSV file to extract all formal concepts from this context. Let me first read and parse the data, then implement the formal concept analysis algorithm.

I've created a comprehensive formal concept analysis tool that extracts all lattice concepts from your CSV data. Here's what the analysis reveals:

**Your Context:**
- Objects: {o1, o2}
- Attributes: {a1, a2, a3}
- Binary relation where "yes" indicates the object has the attribute

**All Formal Concepts Extracted:**

1. **Concept 1**: (∅, {a1, a2, a3}) - Empty extent with all attributes
2. **Concept 2**: ({o1}, {a1, a2}) - Object o1 with attributes a1, a2
3. **Concept 3**: ({o2}, {a2, a3}) - Object o2 with attributes a2, a3
4. **Concept 4**: ({o1, o2}, {a2}) - Both objects with shared attribute a2
5. **Concept 5**: ({o1, o2}, ∅) - All objects with no common attributes

The algorithm works by:
1. Generating all possible object subsets
2. Computing their intent (shared attributes)
3. Computing the extent of that intent (objects having those attributes)
4. Verifying the closure property (extent = original object set)

These concepts form the complete concept lattice for your formal context, representing all meaningful object-attribute relationships in your data.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Based on the formal concept analysis of your CSV data, here are all the lattice concepts in the requested single-line format:

**[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[], [o1, o2]]]**

This represents the 5 formal concepts where each concept is formatted as [[intent], [extent]] - first the attributes (intent), then the objects (extent) that share those attributes.
