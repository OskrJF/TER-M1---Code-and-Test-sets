PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze the formal context in your CSV file and extract all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

Let me start by reading and parsing the data, then compute all the formal concepts.

I've analyzed your formal context and extracted all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis. Here's what I found:

**Context Summary:**
- Objects: o1, o2
- Attributes: a1, a2, a3
- Relations: o1 has attributes {a1, a2}, o2 has attributes {a2, a3}

**All Formal Concepts:**

1. **Concept 1** (Bottom): (∅, {a1, a2, a3})
   - No objects share all three attributes

2. **Concept 2**: ({o1}, {a1, a2})
   - Object o1 has attributes a1 and a2

3. **Concept 3**: ({o2}, {a2, a3})
   - Object o2 has attributes a2 and a3

4. **Concept 4**: ({o1, o2}, {a2})
   - Both objects share attribute a2

5. **Concept 5** (Top): ({o1, o2}, ∅)
   - All objects, but no common attributes beyond what's already captured

The analysis shows there are **5 formal concepts** in total. Each concept is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is the extent (set of objects)
- B is the intent (set of attributes)
- The closure property holds: objects in A are exactly those having all attributes in B, and attributes in B are exactly those shared by all objects in A

The lattice structure shows the hierarchical relationships between these concepts, with the universal concept at the top and the empty concept at the bottom.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]
