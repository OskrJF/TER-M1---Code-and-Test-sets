PROMPT 1 (repeat three times, choose the one with the best results):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll help you extract and enumerate all lattice concepts from this formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Let me create an interactive tool that will process your CSV data and generate all the concepts.

I've created an interactive tool that extracts and enumerates all lattice concepts from your formal context. Here's what the analysis reveals:

**Key Points about the FCA Analysis:**

1. **Formal Context**: Your data represents a formal context with 8 objects (O1-O8) and 8 attributes (a1-a8), where "Yes" indicates the object has the attribute.

2. **Concept Structure**: Each formal concept consists of:
   - **Extent**: The set of objects that share common attributes
   - **Intent**: The set of attributes shared by those objects

3. **Completeness**: The tool generates ALL possible formal concepts by:
   - Computing the closure of every possible object subset
   - Finding the maximal set of objects for each attribute combination
   - Eliminating duplicates to ensure each concept appears only once

4. **Lattice Properties**: The concepts form a complete lattice where:
   - The top concept has all objects but only attributes common to all
   - The bottom concept has all attributes but only objects having all attributes
   - Each concept is maximal in both extent and intent

The tool displays the complete formal context as a table and lists all formal concepts with their extents and intents. This gives you the complete concept lattice structure for your FCA analysis.

You can see how the objects cluster based on their shared attributes, which is fundamental for understanding the conceptual structure of your data in formal concept analysis.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
