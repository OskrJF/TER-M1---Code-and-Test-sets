**1. Concept Lattice Construction via Cross Tables:**
Another practical approach is manually or semi-automatically deriving formal concepts by analyzing the formal contextâ€™s cross table (a binary incidence matrix). One identifies all sets of objects sharing common attributes (intents) and, conversely, all attributes shared by particular object sets (extents). This method relies on computing pairs that satisfy the formal concept definition (where the extent and intent are closed under derivation). This approach is viable for small contexts and offers intuitive insights into the relationships between objects and attributes, making it ideal for educational or exploratory purposes.

**2. Next Closure Algorithm**
The Next Closure algorithm, introduced by Bernhard Ganter, is a foundational method for enumerating all formal concepts in a context. It systematically explores the powerset of attributes using a lectic order and closure operator to generate each concept exactly once in a lexicographic manner. The method relies on computing the closure of attribute sets (via derivation operators) and checking whether each candidate is the next valid closed set. Because of its efficiency and structured traversal, Next Closure is particularly suitable for small contexts, as it avoids redundancy and ensures that all intentsâ€”and thus the associated conceptsâ€”are found in an ordered fashion.

**3. Concept Lattice Construction via Incidence Matrix Traversal:**
Another intuitive method involves **traversing the binary incidence matrix** of the context directly. By examining all possible subsets of objects (or attributes), one can apply the derivation operators to generate the corresponding attribute (or object) sets, thus identifying formal concepts as pairs where the double derivation returns the original subset. Although this method can become computationally expensive for large contexts, it is practical and easy to implement for contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes. It allows direct exploration of the data and is useful for understanding the structure of the concept lattice.

OUTPUT:
Let's go with **Method 1: Concept Lattice Construction via Cross Tables**â€”the most intuitive and hands-on approach for this dataset size. We'll extract **all formal concepts**, i.e., pairs of the form **(extent, intent)** where:

* The **extent** is the set of objects sharing a common set of attributes.
* The **intent** is the set of attributes common to those objects.

---

### ðŸ§  Step-by-step Application of Method 1:

Letâ€™s call:

* $G = \{O1, ..., O15\}$: the set of **objects**
* $M = \{Attr1, ..., Attr15\}$: the set of **attributes**
* $I \subseteq G \times M$: the binary relation where an object has an attribute

We generate all pairs $(A, B)$ where:

* $A' = B$ (i.e., the common attributes of all objects in A)
* $B' = A$ (i.e., the objects having all attributes in B)

Letâ€™s compute the **closed pairs** (formal concepts).

### âœ… Extracted Concepts (extent â†” intent):

Each concept is a **maximal set of objects** that share a **maximal set of attributes**.
