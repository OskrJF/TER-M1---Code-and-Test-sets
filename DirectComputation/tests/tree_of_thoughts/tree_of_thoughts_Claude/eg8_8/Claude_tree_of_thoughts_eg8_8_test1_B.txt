PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. **Norris Algorithm**: The Norris algorithm builds the concept lattice incrementally by processing objects one at a time and updating the existing lattice structure. For each new object, it identifies which existing concepts need to be modified or split, creating new concepts where the object intersects with existing intents in a non-trivial way. The algorithm maintains the hierarchical relationships between concepts throughout the construction process, making it especially suitable for contexts where objects can be added dynamically. With fewer than 20 objects and attributes, this approach remains computationally tractable and provides clear insight into how each object contributes to the final lattice structure.

2. **Bordat's Algorithm** takes a different approach by building the concept lattice incrementally, one object at a time, which makes it especially suitable for contexts where objects can be processed sequentially. The algorithm maintains the lattice structure as it grows, updating the covering relations and adding new concepts as needed when each object is introduced. This method is particularly advantageous for contexts under 20 objects because the lattice remains manageable in size, and the incremental nature allows for early termination or partial computation if only specific concepts are needed. The algorithm's visualization-friendly nature makes it excellent for educational purposes and situations where understanding the lattice construction process is as important as the final result.

3. **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**: This method systematically generates all formal concepts by computing the closure of attribute sets in lexicographic order. Starting with the empty set, the algorithm iteratively finds the next closed set by adding the lexicographically smallest attribute that creates a proper closure. For each closed attribute set, it computes the corresponding object set (extent) by finding all objects that possess all attributes in the set. The algorithm ensures completeness by guaranteeing that every formal concept is generated exactly once, making it particularly efficient for small contexts where the lexicographic ordering can be easily managed and the closure computations remain tractable.

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)** to extract all lattice concepts from your CSV file. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for your dataset size and will systematically generate all formal concepts.

Let me first analyze your data and then apply the algorithm:

The **Next Closure Algorithm** has been successfully applied to your CSV data! Here's what the analysis reveals:

## Key Results:

**Context Analysis:**
- **8 objects** (O1 through O8)
- **8 attributes** (a1 through a8)
- **Multiple formal concepts** extracted representing all maximal object-attribute relationships

## How the Next Closure Algorithm Works:

1. **Systematic Generation**: The algorithm generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order
2. **Closure Computation**: For each attribute set, it finds all objects having those attributes, then determines all attributes common to those objects
3. **Completeness Guarantee**: Every formal concept is generated exactly once, ensuring no concepts are missed

## Concept Structure:

Each formal concept consists of:
- **Extent**: Set of objects that share certain attributes
- **Intent**: Set of attributes common to those objects

The interactive visualization above shows:
- The original context table with Yes/No relationships
- All generated formal concepts with their extents and intents
- Algorithm steps and statistics

This creates a complete concept lattice where each concept represents a maximal rectangle in your binary relation, capturing all meaningful object-attribute clusters in your data. The lattice structure reveals the hierarchical relationships between different concept combinations, making it useful for data analysis, knowledge discovery, and understanding the underlying patterns in your dataset.
