PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**: This systematic approach generates all formal concepts by iteratively computing concept intents using lexicographic ordering. Starting with the empty set, the algorithm applies the closure operator repeatedly, ensuring each new intent is lexicographically greater than the previous one by adding the smallest possible attribute that maintains this ordering. The process continues until no new intents can be generated, guaranteeing that all maximal rectangles in the formal context are discovered. This method is particularly efficient for contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes because it avoids redundant computations and generates concepts in a predictable order, making it ideal for systematic enumeration of the complete concept lattice.

2. **Brute Force Enumeration with Intent-Extent Pairs** offers a straightforward approach where you systematically examine all possible subsets of attributes (or objects) to identify valid formal concepts. For each subset of attributes, you compute its extent by finding all objects that possess every attribute in the subset, then compute the intent of this extent to verify if it matches the original attribute subset. This bidirectional verification ensures that both the Galois connection properties are satisfied: the intent of the extent equals the original attribute set, and the extent of the intent equals the derived object set. While computationally intensive with O(2^n) complexity, this method is practical for small contexts and provides clear insight into the concept formation process, making it valuable for educational purposes and verification of other algorithms.

3. **Matrix-Based Computation** leverages the binary incidence matrix representation of the formal context to identify concepts through linear algebra operations and systematic matrix analysis. This approach involves examining all possible subsets of objects and attributes, then using matrix operations to verify which combinations satisfy the formal concept conditions. For each potential object subset, the method computes the corresponding attribute set by identifying columns where all selected rows have value 1, then verifies the reverse relationship to ensure the attribute set generates the same object set. The method can be optimized using bit operations and matrix multiplication techniques, making it particularly effective for smaller contexts where the computational overhead remains manageable and the visual nature of matrix operations provides additional insight into the structure of the concept lattice.

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)** as it's the most systematic and efficient approach for this small context. Let me first read and analyze your CSV file, then implement the algorithm to extract all formal concepts.

I've applied the **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)** to your CSV data and extracted all formal concepts from the context. Here's what the analysis reveals:

**Your Context:**
- **Objects:** o1, o2
- **Attributes:** a1, a2, a3
- **Relations:** 
  - o1 has attributes {a1, a2}
  - o2 has attributes {a2, a3}

**All Formal Concepts Found:**

1. **Concept 1:** ({o1, o2}, {a2})
   - Both objects share attribute a2

2. **Concept 2:** ({o1}, {a1, a2})
   - Object o1 has both attributes a1 and a2

3. **Concept 3:** ({o2}, {a2, a3})
   - Object o2 has both attributes a2 and a3

4. **Concept 4:** ({}, {})
   - The empty concept (top of the lattice)

The Next Closure Algorithm systematically generates these concepts by:
1. Starting with the empty set
2. Computing the closure (extent and intent) of each attribute combination
3. Finding the next lexicographically ordered intent
4. Continuing until all concepts are discovered

This complete set of 4 formal concepts represents all the maximal rectangles in your formal context matrix, capturing every meaningful relationship between your objects and attributes.
