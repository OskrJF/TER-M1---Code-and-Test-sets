PROMPT 1A (repeat three times, take one of the solutions from each try for PROMPT 1B):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes. Write a single paragraph for each way

OUTPUT:
**Enumeration of All Possible Subsets**: For small contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes, one straightforward approach is to systematically enumerate all possible subsets of objects and compute their corresponding attribute sets using the derivation operators. Starting with each subset A of objects, compute A' (the set of attributes shared by all objects in A), then compute A'' to obtain the extent of the resulting concept. A pair (A'', A') forms a formal concept if and only if A'' = A. This brute-force method has exponential complexity but remains feasible for small contexts, requiring at most 2^19 subset evaluations for objects and ensuring complete coverage of all concepts in the lattice.

**Next-Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**: This method leverages the closure properties of formal concepts to efficiently generate all concepts without redundancy. The algorithm systematically constructs concepts by iteratively computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order, using a "next-closure" operation that ensures each concept is generated exactly once. Starting with the empty set, it computes successive closures while respecting a predetermined ordering of attributes, effectively traversing the concept lattice in a structured manner. This approach is particularly efficient for small contexts as it avoids generating duplicate concepts and has polynomial delay between concept generations, making it significantly faster than exhaustive enumeration.

**Incremental Construction via Object Addition**: This approach builds the concept lattice incrementally by processing objects one at a time and updating the existing lattice structure. Beginning with an empty context, each new object is added along with its attributes, and the algorithm identifies which existing concepts need to be modified or split, while also determining if new concepts need to be created. The method maintains the lattice structure throughout the process by computing meet and join operations between existing concepts and the new object's attribute set. For contexts with fewer than 20 objects, this approach is particularly intuitive and allows for easy visualization of how each additional object affects the final lattice structure.
