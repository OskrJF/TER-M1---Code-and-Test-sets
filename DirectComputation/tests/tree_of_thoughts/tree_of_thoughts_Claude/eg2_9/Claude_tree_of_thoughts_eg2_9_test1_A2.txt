PROMPT 1A (repeat three times, take one of the solutions from each try for PROMPT 1B):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes. Write a single paragraph for each way

OUTPUT:
**NextClosure Algorithm**: The NextClosure algorithm systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in a specific lexicographic order. Starting with the empty set, it iteratively finds the next closure by adding attributes while maintaining the lexicographic ordering constraint. For each generated closure, the algorithm computes both the intent (the closure itself) and the corresponding extent (all objects having these attributes). This method is particularly efficient for small contexts because it avoids redundant computations and generates concepts in a canonical order, making it well-suited for contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes where the total number of concepts remains manageable.

**Ganter's Algorithm (Close-by-One)**: This incremental approach builds formal concepts by systematically exploring the concept lattice through closure operations on individual attributes. The algorithm maintains a queue of potential concept candidates and processes each by computing closures, then generates new candidates by adding single attributes that weren't previously considered. It's especially effective for small contexts because it can leverage the limited search space efficiently, and the recursive nature of the algorithm allows for early termination when exploring branches that won't yield new concepts. The method's strength lies in its ability to handle sparse contexts well, which are common in small-scale formal concept analysis scenarios.

**Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection**: For very small contexts, a brute-force approach using the Galois connection can be practical and straightforward to implement. This method systematically examines all possible subsets of objects and attributes, computing their respective closures under the derivation operators to identify which pairs form valid formal concepts. While computationally intensive for larger contexts, this approach becomes feasible when dealing with fewer than 20 objects and attributes because the search space remains bounded (at most 2^20 subsets to examine). The method's simplicity makes it valuable for educational purposes and verification of results from more sophisticated algorithms, and it provides complete enumeration without requiring complex data structures or ordering constraints.
