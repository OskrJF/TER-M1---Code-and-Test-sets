PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. **Manual Construction via Cross-Table Analysis**: The most straightforward approach for small contexts involves systematically examining the formal context's cross-table to identify all possible object-attribute combinations that form valid concepts. You start by listing all possible subsets of objects, then for each subset, determine its common attributes (the intent), and verify that these attributes don't apply to any objects outside the original subset. This manual verification ensures each concept satisfies the closure property where the extent (objects) and intent (attributes) are maximal with respect to each other. While labor-intensive, this method provides complete understanding of the concept formation process and is entirely feasible for contexts under 20×20.

2. **NextClosure Algorithm Implementation**: The NextClosure algorithm offers an efficient systematic enumeration of all concept intents (attribute sets) in lexicographic order, making it particularly suitable for small to medium-sized contexts. The algorithm maintains a current intent and computes the next lexicographically larger intent that corresponds to a formal concept by applying closure operations and backtracking when necessary. For contexts smaller than 20×20, this algorithm can be implemented straightforwardly and provides both the concept lattice structure and an efficient traversal order, making it ideal for contexts where you need both enumeration and ordering of concepts.

3. **Incremental construction using the Ganter-Kuznetsov algorithm** builds the concept lattice by processing objects one at a time and updating the existing concept structure. Beginning with an initial concept lattice (often just the top and bottom concepts), each new object is integrated by examining how it modifies existing concepts and potentially creates new ones. When adding an object, you identify which existing concepts can be extended to include this object while maintaining the formal concept property, and create new concepts where necessary to preserve the lattice structure. This method is particularly intuitive for small contexts as it mirrors the natural process of gradually building understanding by incorporating new information, and the incremental nature makes it easy to trace and verify each step of the construction process.

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Manual Construction via Cross-Table Analysis** approach since it's the most straightforward for this small context and will provide complete understanding of how each concept is formed.

Let me first read and analyze the CSV file:

I've applied the **Manual Construction via Cross-Table Analysis** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. Here's what the analysis reveals:

## Key Findings:

**Context Overview:**
- 2 objects (o1, o2) 
- 9 attributes (a1-a9)
- The context shows which objects have which attributes (yes/no values)

**Concept Extraction Process:**
1. I systematically examined all possible subsets of objects {∅, {o1}, {o2}, {o1,o2}}
2. For each subset, I computed the common attributes (intent)
3. I verified the closure property by checking that the attributes don't apply to objects outside the original subset
4. Only valid formal concepts (where extent ↔ intent closure holds) are included

The analysis tool above shows:
- The original formal context as a cross-table
- All extracted formal concepts with their extents (objects) and intents (attributes)
- Each concept's size and description
- A summary of the analysis

This manual method is perfect for your small context as it provides complete transparency into how each concept is formed and ensures no concepts are missed. Each concept represents a maximal relationship between a set of objects and their common attributes in your formal context.
