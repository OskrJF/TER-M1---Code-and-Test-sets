PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. **Brute Force Enumeration**: The most straightforward approach for small contexts is to systematically examine all possible subsets of objects and attributes to identify formal concepts. For each subset of objects, compute its corresponding attribute set by finding all attributes shared by those objects, then verify if the resulting attribute set's object set equals the original object subset. This creates a one-to-one correspondence that defines a formal concept. While computationally intensive with O(2^n) complexity, this method is entirely feasible for contexts under 20Ã—20 and guarantees finding all concepts without requiring sophisticated algorithms or data structures.

2. **Ganter's Algorithm (Close-by-One)**: This incremental approach builds formal concepts by systematically exploring the concept lattice through closure operations on individual attributes. The algorithm maintains a queue of potential concept candidates and processes each by computing closures, then generates new candidates by adding single attributes that weren't previously considered. It's especially effective for small contexts because it can leverage the limited search space efficiently, and the recursive nature of the algorithm allows for early termination when exploring branches that won't yield new concepts. The method's strength lies in its ability to handle sparse contexts well, which are common in small-scale formal concept analysis scenarios.

3. **Attribute Exploration with Implications**: This technique leverages the connection between formal concepts and attribute implications to systematically discover the lattice structure. You examine all possible attribute combinations and their corresponding object sets, using implication rules to identify which attribute sets can be extended and which form maximal rectangles in the context matrix. By working through the implication base and closure system, you can identify all concept-forming attribute sets and their corresponding object extents. For small contexts, this approach is highly effective because you can manually trace through the implication chains and verify the completeness of your concept set through the fundamental theorem of formal concept analysis.

OUTPUT:
I'll use **Brute Force Enumeration** since it's the most straightforward approach for this small context and guarantees finding all concepts systematically.

Let me first read and analyze the CSV file, then apply the brute force method to extract all lattice concepts.

I've implemented the **Brute Force Enumeration** method to extract all lattice concepts from your CSV file. This approach systematically examines all possible subsets of objects (2^n subsets) and identifies which ones form formal concepts.

Here's what the algorithm does:

1. **Generates all object subsets**: For your 2 objects (o1, o2), it creates 4 subsets: {}, {o1}, {o2}, {o1,o2}

2. **For each subset**:
   - Computes the **intent** (common attributes shared by all objects in the subset)
   - Computes the **extent** (all objects that have all those attributes)
   - Checks if extent equals the original subset (this defines a formal concept)

3. **Identifies formal concepts**: Only subsets where the extent equals the original object set form valid concepts

The tool will show you:
- The original context matrix with your objects and attributes
- Step-by-step process showing how each subset is evaluated
- All formal concepts found, displayed with their extent (objects) and intent (attributes)
- Total count of concepts discovered

This brute force approach guarantees finding all concepts and is perfect for small contexts like yours. The visualization makes it easy to understand how the formal concept analysis works and verify the completeness of the results.

PROMPT 2B:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! Now the analysis will display the complete list of formal concepts in your requested format at the top of the results section. The format shows each concept as [[intent], [extent]] where:

- **Intent** = the attributes (a1, a2, etc.)
- **Extent** = the objects (o1, o2, etc.)

The tool will generate the formatted output like: `[[[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a3], [o2, o1]], [[a1, a3, a5], [o1]]]` without any quotation marks, exactly as you requested.

This makes it easy to copy the concept list for further analysis or use in other formal concept analysis tools. The brute force enumeration ensures you get all concepts from your context matrix.

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]
