PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. **Brute Force Enumeration**: The most straightforward approach for small contexts is to systematically examine all possible subsets of objects and check which ones form valid formal concepts. For each subset of objects, compute its attribute closure (the set of attributes shared by all objects in the subset), then compute the object closure of those attributes (all objects possessing those attributes). If the original object set equals this double closure, you have found a formal concept. This method has exponential complexity but remains feasible for contexts under 20Ã—20 due to the limited search space, and it guarantees finding all concepts without requiring sophisticated algorithms or data structures.

2. **Closure-Based Derivation Method**: This approach leverages the closure operators inherent in formal concept analysis by starting with individual objects or attributes and iteratively computing their closures. You begin with singleton sets of objects, compute their intents, then find the extents of those intents to identify formal concepts. The process continues by combining existing concepts and checking for new closures until no new concepts can be generated. This method is particularly efficient for sparse contexts where many object-attribute combinations are empty, as it naturally avoids exploring irrelevant combinations and focuses on the actual structure present in the data.

3. **Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection**: This straightforward approach systematically examines all possible subsets of attributes (or objects) and applies the Galois connection operators to determine which form valid formal concepts. For each subset of attributes A, you compute A'' (the closure under both derivation operators) and check if A = A'', indicating a valid concept intent. With fewer than 20 attributes, this means checking at most 2^20 subsets, but in practice, many can be pruned early when their closures have already been computed. While this method may seem brute-force, it's often practical for small contexts because modern computers can handle the enumeration quickly, and it provides clear insight into why certain attribute combinations form concepts while others do not.

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection** approach to extract all lattice concepts from your CSV data. This method is well-suited for your small context and will provide clear insight into the concept structure.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV data. Here's what the tool does:

## Method Overview
The approach systematically examines all possible subsets of attributes (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) and applies the Galois connection operators:

1. **For each attribute subset A**: Computes A'' (double closure)
2. **Checks validity**: If A = A'', then it's a valid concept intent
3. **Finds extent**: Determines which objects possess all attributes in the intent
4. **Eliminates duplicates**: Ensures each concept appears only once

## Your Context Analysis
From your CSV file, I can see:
- **Objects**: o1, o2, o3, o4, o5
- **Attributes**: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5
- **Relations**: "yes" indicates the object has the attribute

Click the "Extract All Concepts" button to see all formal concepts extracted from your data. The tool will show you both the extent (set of objects) and intent (set of attributes) for each concept, along with clear explanations of what each concept represents.

This method is perfect for your small context size and will give you complete insight into the concept lattice structure hidden in your data!

PROMPT 2B:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! Now when you click "Extract All Concepts", the tool will display the concepts in your requested single-line format at the top of the results. The format follows exactly what you specified: `[[intent], [extent]]` for each concept, with intents (attributes) first and extents (objects) second, all without quotation marks.

Click the button to see all the formal concepts from your CSV data displayed in this clean, compact format!

[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
