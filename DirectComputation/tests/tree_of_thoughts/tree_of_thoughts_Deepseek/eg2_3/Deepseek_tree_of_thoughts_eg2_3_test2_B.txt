PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. 1. **Using the NextClosure Algorithm**: The NextClosure algorithm is a systematic method for generating all formal concepts in a formal context. It starts with the smallest concept (the intent of all attributes) and iteratively computes the next concept in lexical order by applying the closure operator. For contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes, this method is efficient because the number of concepts remains manageable. The algorithm ensures completeness, guaranteeing that all concepts are found without redundancy. Its simplicity and deterministic nature make it a reliable choice for small contexts, though it may require careful implementation to handle the closure calculations correctly.

2. Another approach is the **Ganter-Reuter algorithm**, which is a variation of NextClosure optimized for practical efficiency. It leverages the same closure principles but may incorporate heuristic improvements to reduce computational overhead. For small contexts, this method can be implemented straightforwardly, as the limited number of objects and attributes ensures that closure computations remain manageable. The algorithmâ€™s step-by-step progression through the concept lattice ensures that no concepts are missed, and its structure allows for easy verification of results, making it a robust choice for manual or small-scale automated analysis.

3. A third method is to use **brute-force enumeration with a closure check**, suitable for very small contexts. Here, one iterates through all possible subsets of objects or attributes, computes their closures, and checks for concepthood (i.e., whether the subset is closed). While computationally intensive for larger contexts, this method is straightforward and guarantees correctness for small scales. It can be implemented easily using basic set operations and is often used for educational purposes or when verifying results from more advanced algorithms. For contexts with fewer than 20 items, the brute-force approach remains practical due to the manageable size of the power set.

OUTPUT:
For the given small context in `eg2_3.csv`, the **brute-force enumeration with a closure check** is the most straightforward and practical method to extract all formal concepts. Here's how it works step-by-step:

### Formal Context:
- **Objects**: \( O = \{o1, o2\} \)
- **Attributes**: \( A = \{a1, a2, a3\} \)
- **Incidence relation**:
  - \( o1 \): \( a1 \) (yes), \( a2 \) (yes), \( a3 \) (no)
  - \( o2 \): \( a1 \) (no), \( a2 \) (yes), \( a3 \) (yes)

### Step-by-Step Brute-Force Enumeration:
1. **List all subsets of attributes** (power set of \( A \)):
   \[
   \{\}, \{a1\}, \{a2\}, \{a3\}, \{a1, a2\}, \{a1, a3\}, \{a2, a3\}, \{a1, a2, a3\}
   \]

2. **For each subset \( B \subseteq A \), compute its extent (objects sharing all attributes in \( B \)) and then the intent of that extent** (closure check):
   - **\( B = \{\} \)**:
     - Extent: All objects (\( o1, o2 \)).
     - Intent of \( \{o1, o2\} \): \( \{a2\} \) (only \( a2 \) is shared by both \( o1 \) and \( o2 \)).
     - Not a concept (original \( B \neq \) intent).
   - **\( B = \{a1\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{o1\} \) (only \( o1 \) has \( a1 \)).
     - Intent of \( \{o1\} \): \( \{a1, a2\} \).
     - Not a concept.
   - **\( B = \{a2\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{o1, o2\} \).
     - Intent of \( \{o1, o2\} \): \( \{a2\} \).
     - **Concept found**: \( (\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\}) \).
   - **\( B = \{a3\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{o2\} \).
     - Intent of \( \{o2\} \): \( \{a2, a3\} \).
     - Not a concept.
   - **\( B = \{a1, a2\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{o1\} \).
     - Intent of \( \{o1\} \): \( \{a1, a2\} \).
     - **Concept found**: \( (\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\}) \).
   - **\( B = \{a1, a3\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{\} \) (no object has both \( a1 \) and \( a3 \)).
     - Intent of \( \{\} \): \( \{a1, a2, a3\} \).
     - Not a concept.
   - **\( B = \{a2, a3\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{o2\} \).
     - Intent of \( \{o2\} \): \( \{a2, a3\} \).
     - **Concept found**: \( (\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\}) \).
   - **\( B = \{a1, a2, a3\} \)**:
     - Extent: \( \{\} \).
     - Intent of \( \{\} \): \( \{a1, a2, a3\} \).
     - Not a concept.

3. **Add the top and bottom concepts**:
   - **Top concept**: \( (\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\}) \) (empty extent, all attributes).
   - **Bottom concept**: \( (\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\}) \) (already found above).

### Final List of All Formal Concepts:
1. \( (\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\}) \)  
2. \( (\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\}) \)  
3. \( (\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\}) \)  
4. \( (\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\}) \)  

### Concept Lattice (Hasse Diagram):
- Top: \( (\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\}) \)
  - \( (\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\}) \)
  - \( (\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\}) \)
    - Bottom: \( (\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\}) \)

This brute-force method ensures all concepts are found by exhaustive checking, which is feasible for such a small context.
