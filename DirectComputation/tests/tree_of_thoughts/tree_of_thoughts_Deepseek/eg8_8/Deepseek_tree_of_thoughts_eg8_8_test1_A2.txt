PROMPT 1A (repeat three times, take one of the solutions from each try for PROMPT 1B):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes. Write a single paragraph for each way

OUTPUT:
1. **Using the NextClosure Algorithm**: The NextClosure algorithm is a systematic method for computing all formal concepts in a formal context. It generates concepts in a specific order, called the lectic order, by iteratively computing the smallest concept that is larger than the current one with respect to this order. For each set of objects, it calculates the intent (shared attributes) and then verifies whether this pair forms a concept. This method is efficient for small contexts (less than 20 objects/attributes) because it avoids redundant checks and ensures all concepts are found without duplication. Its simplicity and deterministic nature make it a reliable choice for small-scale problems.  

2. **Constructing the Concept Lattice via Attribute Exploration**: Attribute exploration is an interactive method that builds the concept lattice step-by-step by asking an expert to confirm or reject implications between attributes. For small contexts, this can be done manually by listing all possible attribute combinations and verifying which sets of objects share them. Starting with the empty set, one can incrementally generate all valid concept pairs (extent, intent) by intersecting rows (objects) and columns (attributes). This approach is intuitive for small contexts, as the limited number of combinations makes manual verification feasible.  

3. **Employing the Ganter-Reuter Algorithm (or Bordat's Algorithm)**: Bordat's algorithm constructs the concept lattice by traversing the object-attribute relationships directly. It starts with the top concept (all objects) and recursively computes subconcepts by removing one object at a time and determining the corresponding attributes. For small contexts, this method is efficient because it exploits the lattice structure explicitly, avoiding unnecessary computations. Alternatively, Ganter-Reuter optimizes the process by leveraging the lattice's hierarchical properties. Both methods are suitable for small contexts, as their computational overhead remains manageable with fewer than 20 objects and attributes.
