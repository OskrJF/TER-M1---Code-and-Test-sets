PROMPT 1A (repeat three times, take one of the solutions from each try for PROMPT 1B):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes. Write a single paragraph for each way

OUTPUT:
1. **Using the NextClosure Algorithm**: The NextClosure algorithm is a systematic method for enumerating all formal concepts in a formal context. It starts with the smallest concept (the intent of all attributes) and iteratively computes the next concept in lexical order by finding the closure of the current intent plus one additional attribute. This algorithm is efficient for small contexts (less than 20 objects/attributes) because it avoids redundancies and ensures all concepts are generated without duplication. Its simplicity and deterministic nature make it a reliable choice for small datasets, though it may become computationally intensive for larger contexts.

2. **Constructing the Concept Lattice via Attribute Exploration**: Attribute exploration is an interactive method where concepts are built incrementally by questioning an expert about implications between attributes. For small contexts, this can be done manually by listing all possible attribute combinations and verifying their closures. Starting with the empty set, one can systematically add attributes, compute their closures (using the context's incidence relation), and identify valid concepts. This approach is intuitive for small scales and helps build a deeper understanding of the lattice structure, though it requires careful bookkeeping to avoid missing concepts.

3. **Visualizing with Hasse Diagrams via Context Reduction**: For small contexts, one can first compute all concepts by hand or with a tool like ConExp or FCAStone, then draw the Hasse diagram. The process involves listing all object intersections (extents) and their corresponding attribute intersections (intents), then ordering them by subset inclusion. Tools can automate this, but for manual construction, one can start with the top concept (all objects) and bottom concept (all attributes), then fill in intermediate concepts by combining subsets. This method is practical for small contexts due to the manageable number of concepts, and the visual output aids in understanding the lattice hierarchy.
