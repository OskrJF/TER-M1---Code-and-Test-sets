PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. One straightforward approach for very small contexts is direct inspection and manual enumeration. This involves systematically examining subsets of objects and determining their common attributes (to find the intent), and conversely, examining subsets of attributes and determining the objects that share them all (to find the extent). Starting with individual objects, one can list their attributes, then look for other objects sharing those exact attributes. Similarly, one can start with individual attributes, list the objects possessing them, and then see if those objects share any other common attributes. For each potential concept (A, B) found, one must verify the maximality condition: A must be the set of all objects sharing all attributes in B, and B must be the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A. This method relies on careful bookkeeping and becomes cumbersome as the context size increases, but is feasible for tiny contexts.

2. Another method involves **iteratively building concepts using a closure operator**. Start with an empty set of attributes. Find all objects that have these (all objects in the context). This pair (all objects, no attributes) is your first concept. Then, for each attribute not yet in the intent of a discovered concept, add it to the intent of an existing concept. Re-calculate the extent (all objects sharing these attributes) and then re-calculate the intent (all attributes shared by these new objects). This process, often formalized in algorithms like NextClosure or Ganter's Algorithm, systematically explores potential concepts by extending known ones, ensuring that each new pair (extent, intent) is a valid formal concept. For small contexts, this step-by-step generation is manageable and less prone to missing concepts than unsystematic manual checking.

3. A more structured and often more efficient algorithm for small contexts is **NextClosure** or a similar incremental concept generation algorithm. These algorithms typically start with an initial concept (e.g., the concept formed by all objects and their common attributes, or the concept with an empty intent and all objects sharing no common attributes if such exists). They then iteratively generate new concepts by systematically modifying the intent (or extent) of already found concepts, ensuring that each new concept is "closed" (i.e., its extent is maximal for its intent, and its intent is maximal for its extent). For small contexts, you can often perform these steps manually or with simple computational aids, effectively building the lattice concept by concept without exhaustively checking all $2^n$ or $2^m$ subsets.

OUTPUT:
Okay, I will use the first method, "direct inspection and manual enumeration"[cite: 1], to extract all lattice concepts from the context in your .csv file.

## Formal Context Extraction

First, let's parse the data from the `eg2_3.csv` file[cite: 1].
The objects are $G = \{o1, o2\}$.
The attributes are $M = \{a1, a2, a3\}$.
The formal context (the relationships between objects and attributes) is as follows:
* **o1** has attributes: $\{a1, a2\}$ [cite: 1]
* **o2** has attributes: $\{a2, a3\}$ [cite: 1]

## Applying Direct Inspection and Manual Enumeration

This method involves systematically examining subsets of objects to determine their common attributes (the intent), and conversely, examining subsets of attributes to determine the objects that share them all (the extent). For each potential concept $(A, B)$ found (where A is the extent and B is the intent), we must verify the maximality condition: A must be the set of all objects sharing all attributes in B, and B must be the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A[cite: 1].

Let's systematically examine subsets of objects $A \subseteq G$:

1.  **Let $A = \{\}$ (empty set of objects)**
    * The common attributes for an empty set of objects, Intent($\{\}$), is the set of all attributes: $B = \{a1, a2, a3\}$[cite: 1].
    * Now, we find all objects that share all attributes in $B = \{a1, a2, a3\}$, Extent($\{a1, a2, a3\}$).
        * o1 has $\{a1, a2\}$ (does not have a3).
        * o2 has $\{a2, a3\}$ (does not have a1).
        * Thus, no object possesses all attributes $\{a1, a2, a3\}$. So, Extent($\{a1, a2, a3\}$) = $\{\}$.
    * Maximality check: Is $A$ the set of all objects sharing all attributes in $B$? Yes, $\{\} = \text{Extent}(\{a1, a2, a3\})$. Is $B$ the set of all attributes shared by all objects in $A$? Yes, $\{a1, a2, a3\} = \text{Intent}(\{\})$.
    * ✅ Concept 1: **$(\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})$**

2.  **Let $A = \{o1\}$**
    * The common attributes for $\{o1\}$, Intent($\{o1\}$), are the attributes possessed by o1: $B = \{a1, a2\}$[cite: 1].
    * Now, we find all objects that share all attributes in $B = \{a1, a2\}$, Extent($\{a1, a2\}$).
        * o1 has $\{a1, a2\}$.
        * o2 has $\{a2, a3\}$ (does not have a1).
        * Thus, Extent($\{a1, a2\}$) = $\{o1\}$.
    * Maximality check: Is $A$ the set of all objects sharing all attributes in $B$? Yes, $\{o1\} = \text{Extent}(\{a1, a2\})$. Is $B$ the set of all attributes shared by all objects in $A$? Yes, $\{a1, a2\} = \text{Intent}(\{o1\})$.
    * ✅ Concept 2: **$(\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})$**

3.  **Let $A = \{o2\}$**
    * The common attributes for $\{o2\}$, Intent($\{o2\}$), are the attributes possessed by o2: $B = \{a2, a3\}$[cite: 1].
    * Now, we find all objects that share all attributes in $B = \{a2, a3\}$, Extent($\{a2, a3\}$).
        * o1 has $\{a1, a2\}$ (does not have a3).
        * o2 has $\{a2, a3\}$.
        * Thus, Extent($\{a2, a3\}$) = $\{o2\}$.
    * Maximality check: Is $A$ the set of all objects sharing all attributes in $B$? Yes, $\{o2\} = \text{Extent}(\{a2, a3\})$. Is $B$ the set of all attributes shared by all objects in $A$? Yes, $\{a2, a3\} = \text{Intent}(\{o2\})$.
    * ✅ Concept 3: **$(\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})$**

4.  **Let $A = \{o1, o2\}$**
    * The common attributes for $\{o1, o2\}$, Intent($\{o1, o2\}$), are attributes shared by both o1 ($\{a1, a2\}$) and o2 ($\{a2, a3\}$). The intersection is $B = \{a2\}$[cite: 1].
    * Now, we find all objects that share all attributes in $B = \{a2\}$, Extent($\{a2\}$).
        * o1 has $\{a1, a2\}$ (has a2).
        * o2 has $\{a2, a3\}$ (has a2).
        * Thus, Extent($\{a2\}$) = $\{o1, o2\}$.
    * Maximality check: Is $A$ the set of all objects sharing all attributes in $B$? Yes, $\{o1, o2\} = \text{Extent}(\{a2\})$. Is $B$ the set of all attributes shared by all objects in $A$? Yes, $\{a2\} = \text{Intent}(\{o1, o2\})$.
    * ✅ Concept 4: **$(\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})$**

Since we have examined all possible subsets of objects ($2^2 = 4$ subsets), we have found all concepts.

## Extracted Lattice Concepts

The lattice concepts extracted from the context are pairs (Extent, Intent):

1.  **$C_1 = (\{\}, \{a1, a2, a3\})$**
    * Extent: No objects.
    * Intent: Attributes a1, a2, and a3.
2.  **$C_2 = (\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})$**
    * Extent: Object o1.
    * Intent: Attributes a1 and a2.
3.  **$C_3 = (\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})$**
    * Extent: Object o2.
    * Intent: Attributes a2 and a3.
4.  **$C_4 = (\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})$**
    * Extent: Objects o1 and o2.
    * Intent: Attribute a2.
