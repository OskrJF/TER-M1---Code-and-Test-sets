PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1.  One straightforward method is **manual derivation by systematically checking all possible subsets of objects**. For each subset of objects, you determine their common attributes. Then, for this set of common attributes, you find all objects that possess all of them. If this new set of objects is identical to the original subset you started with, then you have found a formal concept. Given the small size of the context (less than 20x20), this exhaustive check, while potentially tedious, is manageable and ensures all concepts are found. You would list all pairs (object-subset, common-attributes-set) that satisfy this closure property.

2. Ganter's NextConcept Algorithm (Conceptual Scaling): This is an incremental algorithm that generates all formal concepts in a specific order, typically lexicographical order of the intents. It starts from a known concept (often (G'', G'), where G' is the set of attributes common to all objects in G, and G'' is the set of objects having all attributes in G') or the concept derived from the empty set of attributes ( (G, ∅') if ∅' is defined, or more practically, starting with the bottom concept (∅'', ∅') if ∅''=G). The algorithm then iteratively finds the "next" concept by making minimal changes to the current concept's intent (or extent) while ensuring the properties of a formal concept are maintained. For each object g not in the current extent A, and for each attribute m not in the current intent B, it explores adding attributes or objects to find the next valid concept. This method is more systematic than brute-force enumeration and avoids redundant calculations.

3. A third technique involves **using a simplified version of an algorithm like NextClosure or Ganter's Algorithm**. These algorithms are designed for larger contexts but can be manually applied or implemented simply for small cases. For instance, one could start with an empty set of objects and an empty set of attributes. Iteratively add an object to the current extent, update the intent, and then update the extent based on the new intent. If the extent-intent pair is new, it's a concept. This process is repeated, systematically exploring potential concepts based on a lexicographical order or similar systematic approach to ensure all concepts are found without exhaustive brute-force enumeration of all subsets.

OUTPUT:
Okay, I will use the first method, **manual derivation by systematically checking all possible subsets of objects**, to extract the formal concepts from the provided .csv file[cite: 1].

## Formal Context

From the `eg2_9.csv` file, we have[cite: 1]:
* **Objects (G):** {o1, o2}
* **Attributes (M):** {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}

The relationships (object has attribute) are:
* **o1:** {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9} [cite: 1]
* **o2:** {a1, a4, a6, a9} [cite: 1]

Attributes a5 and a8 are not possessed by any object in this context. [cite: 1]

## Method Used

I will use the first method described: "manual derivation by systematically checking all possible subsets of objects. For each subset of objects, you determine their common attributes. Then, for this set of common attributes, you find all objects that possess all of them. If this new set of objects is identical to the original subset you started with, then you have found a formal concept." [cite: 1]

## Derivation of Formal Concepts

Let A be a subset of objects, A' be the set of common attributes for A, and A'' be the set of objects possessing all attributes in A'. A formal concept is a pair (A, A') such that A'' = A.

The possible subsets of objects are ∅, {o1}, {o2}, and {o1, o2}.

**1. Object subset A = ∅**
    * Common attributes (A'): This is the set of all attributes in the context, M = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}.
    * Objects possessing all attributes in A' (A''):
        * o1 possesses {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9} but not {a5, a6, a8}. [cite: 1]
        * o2 possesses {a1, a4, a6, a9} but not {a2, a3, a5, a7, a8}. [cite: 1]
        * Therefore, no object possesses all attributes in M. So, A'' = ∅.
    * Check if A'' = A: ∅ = ∅. Yes.
    * **Concept 1: (∅, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})**

---
**2. Object subset A = {o1}**
    * Common attributes (A'): These are the attributes of o1, which are {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}. [cite: 1]
    * Objects possessing all attributes in {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9} (A''):
        * o1: Yes. [cite: 1]
        * o2: No (o2 does not have a2, a3, a7). [cite: 1]
        * So, A'' = {o1}.
    * Check if A'' = A: {o1} = {o1}. Yes.
    * **Concept 2: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})**

---
**3. Object subset A = {o2}**
    * Common attributes (A'): These are the attributes of o2, which are {a1, a4, a6, a9}. [cite: 1]
    * Objects possessing all attributes in {a1, a4, a6, a9} (A''):
        * o1: No (o1 does not have a6). [cite: 1]
        * o2: Yes. [cite: 1]
        * So, A'' = {o2}.
    * Check if A'' = A: {o2} = {o2}. Yes.
    * **Concept 3: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})**

---
**4. Object subset A = {o1, o2}**
    * Common attributes (A'): These are the attributes shared by both o1 and o2.
        * Attributes(o1) = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9} [cite: 1]
        * Attributes(o2) = {a1, a4, a6, a9} [cite: 1]
        * Intersection = {a1, a4, a9}.
        * So, A' = {a1, a4, a9}.
    * Objects possessing all attributes in {a1, a4, a9} (A''):
        * o1: Yes (has a1, a4, a9). [cite: 1]
        * o2: Yes (has a1, a4, a9). [cite: 1]
        * So, A'' = {o1, o2}.
    * Check if A'' = A: {o1, o2} = {o1, o2}. Yes.
    * **Concept 4: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})**
