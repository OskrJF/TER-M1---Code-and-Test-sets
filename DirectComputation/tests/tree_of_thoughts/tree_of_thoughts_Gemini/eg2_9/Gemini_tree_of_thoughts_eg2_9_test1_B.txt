PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

1. One straightforward approach is to **manually identify all possible attribute combinations and their corresponding object sets**. Start by considering individual attributes and find all objects possessing each attribute. Then, examine pairs of attributes, then triplets, and so on, determining the set of objects common to each combination. For each such object set (called an extent), find all attributes shared by exactly those objects (called an intent). Each (extent, intent) pair that is maximal (i.e., you can't add another object to the extent without losing an attribute from the intent, and you can't add another attribute to the intent without losing an object from the extent) is a formal concept. Given the small size of the context, this exhaustive check, while potentially tedious, is manageable and helps in understanding the fundamental definition of a concept.

2. Another method is to use a **basic bottom-up algorithm**, often referred to as a variant of **NextClosure** or a similar incremental algorithm. You start by finding the concepts associated with individual objects. For each object $g$, its intent $g'$ is the set of all attributes it possesses. Then, the extent $(g')'$ is the set of all objects sharing exactly those attributes in $g'$. This pair $((g')', g')$ forms a concept. You can then iteratively build upon these initial concepts by considering intersections of extents (or unions of intents) and computing their respective closures. For small contexts, systematically checking pairs of existing concepts and deriving new ones from their common attributes or objects until no new concepts can be found is computationally manageable.

3. A third effective technique, especially amenable to small contexts and often used as a basis for more complex algorithms, is to employ a **NextClosure-like algorithm or a Ganter-Wille style algorithm by hand**. This involves starting with an initial concept (e.g., ({all objects}, common attributes of all objects}) or ({objects sharing attribute m}, {m}'' for some attribute m). Then, you systematically generate the next concept in a lexicographical or other defined order. This often involves finding a "minimal generator" or an "attribute that violates the current closure" and using it to form a new, larger intent (and corresponding smaller extent). You iteratively apply rules to find the "next" concept until all concepts have been discovered. For small contexts, this can be done systematically on paper by listing objects and attributes and carefully applying the closure operator (finding all common attributes for a set of objects, and then all objects possessing those attributes).

OUTPUT:
Okay, I will use the first method described to extract the formal concepts from the provided .csv file[cite: 1].

**Method 1: Manually identify all possible attribute combinations and their corresponding object sets.**
This approach involves starting by considering individual attributes to find objects possessing them. Then, one examines pairs, triplets, etc., of attributes to find common object sets. For each object set (extent), we find all attributes shared by exactly those objects (intent). An (extent, intent) pair is a formal concept if it's maximal. Given the small number of objects, it's more direct to consider all possible subsets of objects as potential extents.

The data from the .csv file is[cite: 1]:
Objects: $G = \{o_1, o_2\}$
Attributes: $M = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\}$

The attributes for each object are:
* $o_1: \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\}$ [cite: 1]
* $o_2: \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\}$ [cite: 1]

Let $A$ be a set of objects (an extent) and $B$ be a set of attributes (an intent).
The notation $A'$ (prime of A) means the set of attributes common to all objects in $A$.
The notation $B'$ (prime of B) means the set of objects that possess all attributes in $B$.
A pair $(A, B)$ is a formal concept if $A' = B$ and $B' = A$. This implies that $A = (A')'$ and $B = (B')'$.

We will test all possible subsets of objects $G_{sub} \subseteq G$ as potential extents.
The possible subsets of objects are: $\emptyset, \{o_1\}, \{o_2\}, \{o_1, o_2\}$.

## Identifying the Formal Concepts

1.  **Potential Extent: $\emptyset$ (empty set of objects)**
    * Intent($\emptyset$): The set of attributes common to all objects in an empty set is, by definition, the set of all attributes.
        $B = \emptyset' = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\}$.
    * Extent($B$): The set of objects that possess all attributes in $B$.
        Neither $o_1$ nor $o_2$ possesses all 9 attributes. For example, $o_1$ does not have $a_5, a_6, a_8$[cite: 1], and $o_2$ does not have $a_2, a_3, a_5, a_7, a_8$[cite: 1].
        So, $B' = \emptyset$.
    * Since $\emptyset' = B$ and $B' = \emptyset$, the pair $(\emptyset, \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\})$ is a formal concept.
    * **Concept 1: $(\emptyset, \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9\})$**

2.  **Potential Extent: $\{o_1\}$**
    * Intent($\{o_1\}$): The set of attributes possessed by $o_1$.
        $B = \{o_1\}' = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\}$[cite: 1].
    * Extent($B$): The set of objects that possess all attributes in $B = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\}$.
        * $o_1$ possesses all attributes in $B$.
        * $o_2$ possesses $a_1, a_4, a_9$ but lacks $a_2, a_3, a_7$[cite: 1].
        So, $B' = \{o_1\}$.
    * Since $\{o_1\}' = B$ and $B' = \{o_1\}$, the pair $(\{o_1\}, \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\})$ is a formal concept.
    * **Concept 2: $(\{o_1\}, \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\})$**

3.  **Potential Extent: $\{o_2\}$**
    * Intent($\{o_2\}$): The set of attributes possessed by $o_2$.
        $B = \{o_2\}' = \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\}$[cite: 1].
    * Extent($B$): The set of objects that possess all attributes in $B = \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\}$.
        * $o_1$ possesses $a_1, a_4, a_9$ but lacks $a_6$[cite: 1].
        * $o_2$ possesses all attributes in $B$.
        So, $B' = \{o_2\}$.
    * Since $\{o_2\}' = B$ and $B' = \{o_2\}$, the pair $(\{o_2\}, \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\})$ is a formal concept.
    * **Concept 3: $(\{o_2\}, \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\})$**

4.  **Potential Extent: $\{o_1, o_2\}$**
    * Intent($\{o_1, o_2\}$): The set of attributes common to both $o_1$ and $o_2$.
        Attributes of $o_1$: $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\}$ [cite: 1]
        Attributes of $o_2$: $\{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\}$ [cite: 1]
        $B = \{o_1, o_2\}' = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_7, a_9\} \cap \{a_1, a_4, a_6, a_9\} = \{a_1, a_4, a_9\}$.
    * Extent($B$): The set of objects that possess all attributes in $B = \{a_1, a_4, a_9\}$.
        * $o_1$ possesses $a_1, a_4, a_9$.
        * $o_2$ possesses $a_1, a_4, a_9$.
        So, $B' = \{o_1, o_2\}$.
    * Since $\{o_1, o_2\}' = B$ and $B' = \{o_1, o_2\}$, the pair $(\{o_1, o_2\}, \{a_1, a_4, a_9\})$ is a formal concept.
    * **Concept 4: $(\{o_1, o_2\}, \{a_1, a_4, a_9\})$**
