PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
In **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**, when dealing with a **formal context** of fewer than 20 objects and 20 attributes, the problem size is small enough to use several effective methods to compute the **formal concepts** (i.e., the elements of the concept lattice). Here are three common ways to find the lattice concepts in such small contexts:

---

### **1. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter’s Algorithm)**

* **Description**: This is the most commonly used algorithm in FCA for generating all formal concepts in lectic (lexicographical) order.
* **How it works**:

  * Iteratively generates all **closed sets** (intents), using a closure operator and a lectic ordering of attributes.
  * For each closed set (intent), the corresponding extent is computed.
* **Why it's good for small contexts**:

  * Efficient even with larger contexts but especially quick for contexts under 20×20.
* **Reference**: Ganter, B. (1984). *Two basic algorithms in concept analysis.*

---

### **2. Bordat’s Algorithm**

* **Description**: This approach incrementally builds the lattice starting from the bottom (least concept) and explores upper neighbors.
* **How it works**:

  * Starts with the least formal concept (all objects, common attributes).
  * Recursively constructs upper neighbors by adding minimal generators.
* **Advantages**:

  * Naturally builds the **Hasse diagram** of the lattice.
  * Efficient when the number of concepts is not too large.
* **Reference**: Bordat, J.-P. (1986). *Calcul pratique du treillis des concepts d'une table binaire.*

---

### **3. Direct Enumeration via Closure Operators**

* **Description**: Brute-force approach using powerset enumeration with attribute closure.
* **How it works**:

  * Enumerate all subsets of attributes (max 2²⁰ = 1,048,576, which is still feasible with pruning).
  * For each subset $A$, compute the closure $A''$.
  * Keep only the fixed points $A = A''$ as **intents** and compute their extents.
* **Optimizations**:

  * Use caching and early stopping when a subset is not closed.
  * Works well for exploratory or pedagogical tools.
* **Use case**:

  * Suitable when the total number of concepts is expected to be low (e.g., ≤1000).

Let me know if you’d like an implementation example or a visual demo for any of these methods.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the next context:
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5
o1;yes;no;yes;yes;no
o2;no;no;yes;no;no
o3;yes;yes;no;yes;yes
o4;no;yes;no;no;yes
o5;no;yes;no;no;no

OUTPUT:
Let's choose **Ganter’s Next Closure Algorithm**, the most commonly used and efficient for small contexts, to extract all **formal concepts** (extent-intent pairs) from your given context.

### ✅ **Step 1: Parse the Formal Context**

#### **Formal Context (Objects × Attributes)**

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a5  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o1     | yes | no  | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | no  | yes | no  | no  |
| o3     | yes | yes | no  | yes | yes |
| o4     | no  | yes | no  | no  | yes |
| o5     | no  | yes | no  | no  | no  |

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Definitions for FCA**

Let:

* $G = \{o1, o2, o3, o4, o5\}$ (objects)
* $M = \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5\}$ (attributes)
* $I \subseteq G \times M$ is the binary relation "object has attribute".

Define derivation operators:

* $A' = \{ m \in M \mid \forall g \in A: (g, m) \in I \}$
* $B' = \{ g \in G \mid \forall m \in B: (g, m) \in I \}$

A **formal concept** is a pair $(A, B)$ such that $A' = B$ and $B' = A$.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Apply Ganter’s Next Closure Algorithm**

We proceed to generate all **closed attribute sets** (intents) and their corresponding extents. The closure of a set of attributes $X \subseteq M$ is:

$$
X'' = \{ m \in M \mid \text{every object that has all attributes in } X \text{ also has } m \}
$$

For brevity, I’ll compute all formal concepts manually here (you can later automate with code if needed):

### ✅ **All Formal Concepts** (Extent, Intent)

Here is the list of **formal concepts** for this context:

1. **({o1, o2, o3, o4, o5}, ∅)**
2. **({o3, o4, o5}, {a2})**
3. **({o3, o4}, {a2, a5})**
4. **({o3}, {a1, a2, a4, a5})**
5. **({o4}, {a2, a5})**  *(Duplicate of 3; ignore)*
6. **({o3, o1}, {a1, a4})**
7. **({o1, o2}, {a3})**
8. **({o1}, {a1, a3, a4})**
9. **({o2}, {a3})**  *(Duplicate of 7; ignore)*
10. **({o5}, {a2})** *(Duplicate of 2; ignore)*

We remove duplicates and get:

### ✅ **Final List of Unique Formal Concepts**

| # | Extent (Objects)     | Intent (Attributes) |
| - | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5} | ∅                   |
| 2 | {o3, o4, o5}         | {a2}                |
| 3 | {o3, o4}             | {a2, a5}            |
| 4 | {o3}                 | {a1, a2, a4, a5}    |
| 5 | {o3, o1}             | {a1, a4}            |
| 6 | {o1, o2}             | {a3}                |
| 7 | {o1}                 | {a1, a3, a4}        |
