PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
In Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), when working with a *formal context* (a binary relation between a finite set of objects and a finite set of attributes), the goal is to derive the *concept lattice*. For small contexts (e.g., <20 objects and attributes), three practical methods for computing the formal concepts (i.e., the nodes of the lattice) are:

---

### **1. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**

**Use case**: Standard and efficient for small and medium-sized contexts.

* **Approach**: Systematically enumerates all intents (sets of attributes) in lectic (lexicographic) order, using a closure operator.
* **Steps**:

  1. Start with the empty intent.
  2. At each step, compute the closure of a candidate attribute set.
  3. Use a *canonicity test* to ensure each intent is generated exactly once.
* **Advantages**:

  * Efficient.
  * Generates concepts in a specific order useful for visualization or processing.

---

### **2. Concept Enumeration via Powerset Search with Pruning**

**Use case**: Straightforward for brute-force approaches; useful for didactic or exploratory purposes.

* **Approach**: Explore all subsets of the attribute set (powerset) and compute the corresponding extents and check for closure.
* **Steps**:

  1. Iterate over all subsets of attributes.
  2. For each subset $A$, compute its extent $A'$ (objects having all attributes in $A$).
  3. Then compute the intent $(A')'$.
  4. If $(A')' = A$, then $(A', A)$ is a formal concept.
* **Advantages**:

  * Easy to implement.
* **Disadvantages**:

  * Computationally expensive for larger contexts (but acceptable for ≤20 attributes).

### **3. Bordat’s Algorithm (Graph-based Construction)**

**Use case**: Useful when building the concept lattice incrementally.

* **Approach**: Explores the lattice structure by incrementally constructing concepts and their ordering based on object inclusion.
* **Steps**:

  1. Start from the bottom concept (with all objects and their common attributes).
  2. Recursively explore upper neighbors by adding distinguishing attributes.
  3. Use implications among attributes to prune and order the search.
* **Advantages**:

  * Constructs the lattice structure directly (not just the list of concepts).
  * Allows early stopping or partial lattice construction.

Would you like code examples or tool recommendations (like ConExp, ToscanaJ, or Python libraries like `concepts`) to implement these methods?

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the net context:
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9
o1;yes;yes;yes;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes
o2;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes

OUTPUT:
Let’s use **Ganter’s Next Closure Algorithm** to extract **all formal concepts** from the given formal context. This method is efficient and systematic — perfect for small contexts like yours.

### 🔢 **Formal Context (Parsed)**

|        | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 | a6 | a7 | a8 | a9 |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **o1** | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ✔️ |
| **o2** | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ✔️ | ❌  | ❌  | ✔️ |

### 📚 **Definitions for Next Closure Algorithm**

Let:

* $G = \{o1, o2\}$ (objects)
* $M = \{a1, a2, ..., a9\}$ (attributes)
* $I \subseteq G \times M$ (the incidence relation)

We use the **derivation operators**:

* For a set of attributes $A \subseteq M$:
  $A' = \{g \in G \mid \forall m \in A, (g, m) \in I\}$
* For a set of objects $B \subseteq G$:
  $B' = \{m \in M \mid \forall g \in B, (g, m) \in I\}$

A pair $(A', A'')$ is a **formal concept**.

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Concept Extraction**

We will iterate over all **attribute subsets** in **lectic order** and check if $A = A''$. If so, we record $(A', A)$ as a concept.

I'll now extract **all formal concepts** manually:

#### ℹ️ Helper Table: Object Attributes

* **o1**: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
* **o2**: {a1, a4, a6, a9}

---

#### 📌 Concepts:

Let’s compute the **closed attribute sets** and their corresponding object sets:

1. **∅**

   * $∅' = \{o1, o2\}$
   * $∅'' = \{a1, a4, a9\}$
   * Concept: $(\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})$

2. **{a1}**

   * o1, o2 ⇒ closed: $(\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})$ → already found

3. **{a2}**

   * o1 only → $\{o1\}'' = \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\}$
   * Concept: $(\{o1\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\})$

4. **{a3}**

   * o1 only → same closure as above → already found

5. **{a6}**

   * o2 only → $\{o2\}'' = \{a1, a4, a6, a9\}$
   * Concept: $(\{o2\}, \{a1, a4, a6, a9\})$

6. **{a5}**, **{a8}** – not present in either o1 or o2 → skip

7. **{a1, a6}**

   * Only o2 → same as above → already found

8. **{a1, a2, a3}**

   * o1 only → closure: $\{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\}$ → already found

9. **{a1, a4, a9}**

   * Both objects → closure is itself
   * Already found

10. **{a1, a2, a4, a9}**

    * o1 only → closure: $\{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\}$ → already found

11. **{a1, a4}**

    * o1 and o2 → closure: $\{a1, a4, a9\}$

12. **Full set**: {a1, a2, ..., a9}

    * No object has all → $∅$
    * $∅'' = M$ → Concept: $(\emptyset, M)$

### 🧱 Final List of Concepts (Extent, Intent):

1. $(\{o1, o2\}, \{a1, a4, a9\})$
2. $(\{o1\}, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\})$
3. $(\{o2\}, \{a1, a4, a6, a9\})$
4. $(\emptyset, \{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\})$
