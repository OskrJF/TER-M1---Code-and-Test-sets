PROMPT 1: In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
In **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**, when dealing with a **formal context** (a cross-table of objects and attributes) with fewer than 20 objects and attributes, you can efficiently compute all **formal concepts** (pairs of object sets and attribute sets forming a Galois connection) using various methods. Here are **three commonly used approaches**:

---

### 1. **Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**

This is the **canonical** method used in FCA to generate all formal concepts in a lectic (lexicographic) order.

#### How it works:

* Uses the **closure operator** on sets of attributes.
* Generates each concept by computing the closure of subsets in a systematic order.
* Ensures that each concept is found exactly once.

#### Why use it:

* Deterministic and complete.
* Efficient for small contexts (like < 20×20).
* Generates concepts in a sorted (lectic) order.

---

### 2. **Concept Lattice Construction via Bordat’s Algorithm**

This is a **top-down approach** that builds the concept lattice incrementally by discovering successors (children) of a concept.

#### How it works:

* Starts from the top concept (the concept with all objects).
* Recursively computes **lower neighbors** by removing attributes and computing closures.
* Constructs the Hasse diagram (the actual lattice structure) as it proceeds.

#### Why use it:

* Useful when you want to **visualize or build the lattice** structure as a graph.
* Also effective on small contexts.

---

### 3. **Data-Powered Exhaustive Search with Pruning**

This is a **brute-force-based** approach optimized by early pruning using closure conditions.

#### How it works:

* Iterate over all subsets of attributes (or objects).
* For each subset, compute its closure.
* Store only unique (extent, intent) pairs.

#### Why use it:

* Easy to implement in scripting languages (e.g., Python).
* Feasible due to the small size of the context (< 20 × 20 → \~1 million attribute subsets max).
* Good for educational or exploratory purposes.

| Method                  | Strategy      | Best For                   | Notes                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Next Closure (Ganter)   | Lexicographic | Full concept enumeration   | Canonical, efficient   |
| Bordat’s Algorithm      | Top-down      | Lattice structure building | Good for visualization |
| Exhaustive with Pruning | Brute-force   | Simple, small contexts     | Easy to code/test      |

Let me know if you'd like an implementation of any of these in Python or pseudocode.

PROMPT 2: Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the next context:
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Let's go with **Ganter's Next Closure Algorithm**, the canonical and efficient method in FCA, especially good for small contexts like this one.

### 🔢 **Step-by-Step with Ganter’s Next Closure Algorithm**

#### **Input Context:**

|        | a1 | a2 | a3 |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- |
| **o1** | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌  |
| **o2** | ❌  | ✔️ | ✔️ |

We interpret:

* `yes` as ✓ (attribute present)
* `no` as ✗ (attribute absent)

#### **Formal Context (G, M, I):**

* Objects: G = {o1, o2}
* Attributes: M = {a1, a2, a3}
* Incidence relation I:

  * (o1, a1), (o1, a2)
  * (o2, a2), (o2, a3)

---

### 🔁 **Core Algorithm Idea (Attribute closure):**

Given a set of attributes **X ⊆ M**, compute:

1. **Extent (X')**: all objects that have **all attributes in X**
2. **Intent (X'')**: all attributes shared by those objects (closure)

A formal concept is the pair (X', X''), where **X'' is the closure of X**.

---

### ✅ **Step-by-Step Computation**

#### We generate all subsets of M = {a1, a2, a3} in lexicographic (lectic) order:

---

1. **{}**

* X = {}
* X' = {o1, o2} (all objects have all of nothing)
* X'' = common attributes of o1 & o2 = {a2}
* Concept: (**{o1, o2}**, **{a2}**)

---

2. **{a1}**

* o1 has a1, o2 does not → X' = {o1}
* X'' = attributes of o1 = {a1, a2}
* Concept: (**{o1}**, **{a1, a2}**)

---

3. **{a2}**

* o1 and o2 both have a2 → X' = {o1, o2}
* X'' = common attributes = {a2}
* Already found above → skip (duplicate)

---

4. **{a3}**

* o2 has a3, o1 does not → X' = {o2}
* X'' = attributes of o2 = {a2, a3}
* Concept: (**{o2}**, **{a2, a3}**)

---

5. **{a1, a2}**

* Only o1 has both → X' = {o1}
* X'' = attributes of o1 = {a1, a2}
* Already found above → skip

---

6. **{a1, a3}**

* No object has both a1 and a3 → X' = ∅
* X'' = all attributes (by vacuous truth) = {}
* Concept: (**∅**, **{}**)

---

7. **{a2, a3}**

* Only o2 has both → X' = {o2}
* X'' = attributes of o2 = {a2, a3}
* Already found → skip

---

8. **{a1, a2, a3}**

* No object has all three → X' = ∅
* X'' = {}
* Already found

---

### 📌 **Final List of Formal Concepts**

| Extent   | Intent   |
| -------- | -------- |
| {o1, o2} | {a2}     |
| {o1}     | {a1, a2} |
| {o2}     | {a2, a3} |
| ∅        | ∅        |
