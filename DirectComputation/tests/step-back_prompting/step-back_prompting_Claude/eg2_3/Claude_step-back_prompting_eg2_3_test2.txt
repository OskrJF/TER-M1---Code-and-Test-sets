PROMPT 1: In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three effective methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

**1. NextClosure Algorithm**
This is one of the most efficient algorithms for small contexts. It systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order. The algorithm uses the closure operator to find maximal rectangles in the formal context, ensuring each concept is generated exactly once. For contexts under 20×20, it typically runs very quickly and produces concepts in a canonical order that's useful for lattice construction.

**2. Ganter's Algorithm (Attribute Exploration)**
This approach builds concepts incrementally by exploring the attribute space. It starts with the empty set and systematically adds attributes, computing closures at each step. The algorithm is particularly effective for sparse contexts and naturally handles the dual relationship between object and attribute closures. It's well-suited for contexts where you want to understand the conceptual structure as it's being built.

**3. Direct Matrix Computation Method**
For very small contexts, you can enumerate all possible attribute subsets (2^n where n < 20), compute their closures using the formal context matrix, and identify which ones form valid concepts. While this brute-force approach becomes computationally expensive for larger contexts, it's straightforward to implement and understand for contexts with fewer than 15-16 attributes. You simply check each subset to see if applying the derivation operators twice returns the original set.

Each method has trade-offs in terms of implementation complexity, memory usage, and computational efficiency, but all are practical for contexts of your specified size.

PROMPT 2: Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Matrix Computation Method** since this context is very small (2 objects, 3 attributes), making it perfect for demonstrating the brute-force enumeration approach.

I've chosen the **Direct Matrix Computation Method** for your small context. This method works by:

1. **Generating all possible attribute subsets** (2³ = 8 subsets for your 3 attributes)
2. **Computing derivations** for each subset using the formal context matrix
3. **Identifying valid concepts** where the closure operation returns the original set

The tool above processes your CSV file and shows:
- The formal context as a visual matrix
- Step-by-step computation showing how each attribute subset is processed
- All formal concepts found in the lattice
- A summary of the results

For your context with objects {o1, o2} and attributes {a1, a2, a3}, this method will find all formal concepts by systematically checking every possible combination of attributes and determining which ones form valid concept pairs with their corresponding object sets.

This brute-force approach is perfect for small contexts like yours because it's comprehensive, easy to understand, and computationally feasible for contexts under 20×20.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
The tool now displays the concepts in your requested single-line format at the bottom. For your specific context, the answer is:

[[[]], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
