PROMPT 1: In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three effective methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

**1. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**
This is the most widely used method for concept enumeration. It systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order. The algorithm ensures each concept is generated exactly once and works efficiently for small contexts. You start with the empty set, compute its closure, then iteratively find the next closure in canonical order until all concepts are found.

**2. Brute Force Enumeration with Closure Computation**
For small contexts, you can simply enumerate all possible subsets of attributes (2^n subsets where n ≤ 20), compute the closure of each subset using the derivation operators, and collect the unique intent-extent pairs. While this has exponential complexity, it's straightforward to implement and perfectly feasible for contexts with fewer than 20 attributes since 2^20 ≈ 1 million operations.

**3. Object-by-Object Incremental Construction**
Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object at a time to an initially empty context. For each new object, you update the existing lattice structure by splitting concepts whose intents are not compatible with the new object's attributes. This method is particularly useful when you want to understand how the lattice structure evolves and is efficient for contexts where objects are processed sequentially.

Each method has its strengths: Next Closure is theoretically optimal, brute force is simple to understand and implement, and incremental construction provides insight into lattice dynamics.

PROMPT 2: Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Brute Force Enumeration with Closure Computation** method since it's straightforward to implement and visualize for this small context. Let me create an interactive tool that processes your CSV file and finds all the formal concepts.

I've implemented the **brute force enumeration method** to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. The tool:

1. **Loads your CSV file** and parses the formal context with objects {o1, o2} and attributes {a1, a2, a3}

2. **Generates all possible attribute subsets** (2³ = 8 subsets total) and computes their closures using the derivation operators

3. **Identifies closed sets** by checking if each attribute subset equals its own closure - these are the formal concepts

4. **Displays the results** showing each concept as an (Intent, Extent) pair

For your specific context:
- **o1** has attributes {a1, a2} 
- **o2** has attributes {a2, a3}

The algorithm systematically checks every possible combination of attributes to find all maximal rectangles in your object-attribute incidence matrix. This brute force approach is perfect for small contexts like yours and gives you a complete view of the concept lattice structure.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! The tool now displays all formal concepts in the exact format you requested. For your context with objects {o1, o2} and attributes {a1, a2, a3}, it will show the complete list of concepts as a single line in the format [[intent], [extent]] without quotation marks.
[[[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
