PROMPT 1: In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three effective methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and 20 attributes):

## 1. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most widely used method for concept generation. It systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order. The algorithm maintains a canonical order and only generates each concept once, making it very efficient for small contexts.

**How it works:** Start with the empty set, compute its closure to get the first concept, then systematically find the "next" attribute set in lexicographic order that produces a new concept. The closure operation finds all attributes shared by objects that have the current attribute set.

**Advantages:** Guaranteed to find all concepts exactly once, memory efficient, and well-suited for contexts of your size.

## 2. Brute Force Enumeration with Closure Testing

For contexts under 20×20, you can enumerate all possible attribute subsets (2^n possibilities) and test each one to see if it forms a concept by checking if its double closure equals itself.

**How it works:** For each subset A of attributes, compute A'' (the set of attributes common to all objects that have all attributes in A). If A = A'', then A is a concept intent. The corresponding extent is A' (all objects having all attributes in A).

**Advantages:** Simple to implement and understand, works well for small contexts, easy to parallelize.

## 3. Incremental Concept Construction

Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object (or attribute) at a time and updating the existing concept structure.

**How it works:** Start with concepts derived from the first few objects, then for each new object, determine how it intersects with existing concepts. Some concepts may be split, merged, or new ones created. This approach is particularly useful when you're building the context dynamically.

**Advantages:** Useful when your context is being built incrementally, provides insight into how each object contributes to the concept structure, and can be stopped early if you only need partial results.

For contexts of your specified size, the Next Closure algorithm is typically the most practical choice, as it balances efficiency with guaranteed completeness.

PROMPT 2: Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Brute Force Enumeration with Closure Testing** method since it's straightforward to implement and visualize for this small 2×3 context.

I've implemented the **Brute Force Enumeration with Closure Testing** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. The algorithm works by:

1. **Generating all possible attribute subsets** (2³ = 8 subsets for your 3 attributes)
2. **Computing closures** for each subset using the double closure operation
3. **Testing for concept validity** by checking if A'' = A (where A is an attribute set)
4. **Filtering duplicates** to get the final set of formal concepts

From your context with objects {o1, o2} and attributes {a1, a2, a3}, the algorithm systematically finds all valid formal concepts by testing every possible combination. Each concept is displayed with its extent (set of objects) and intent (set of attributes).

This method is particularly well-suited for your small context size and provides a clear, step-by-step approach that's easy to verify manually if needed.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
The single line format with all concepts from your CSV context is now displayed at the bottom of the interface. The format follows your specification: [[intent], [extent]] for each concept, where intent contains the attributes and extent contains the objects, all without quotation marks.
[[[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
