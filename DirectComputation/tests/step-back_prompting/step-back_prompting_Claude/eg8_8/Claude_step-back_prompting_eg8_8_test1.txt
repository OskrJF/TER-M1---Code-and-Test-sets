PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three approaches to find lattice concepts in a small formal context (< 20 objects and attributes):

## 1. Direct Enumeration with Closure Operations

For small contexts, you can systematically enumerate all possible object sets and compute their concept closures. Start with the empty set and single objects, then build up:

- For each subset A of objects, compute A'' (the closure: objects → attributes → objects)
- If A = A'', then (A, A') forms a concept
- A' is the set of attributes shared by all objects in A

This brute-force approach works well for small contexts since you have at most 2^20 subsets to check.

## 2. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most efficient systematic approach for contexts of this size:

- Generate concepts in lexicographic order using closure operations
- Start with the bottom concept and iteratively find the "next" concept
- Uses a clever incremental technique that avoids redundant computations
- Guarantees each concept is found exactly once

The algorithm maintains canonical order and is particularly efficient for sparse contexts.

## 3. Attribute-Incremental Construction

Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one attribute at a time:

- Start with the lattice for the first few attributes
- For each new attribute, determine which existing concepts it intersects with
- Split and merge concepts as needed to maintain the lattice structure
- Update the ordering relations between concepts

This approach is intuitive and allows you to visualize how each attribute contributes to the final lattice structure. It's especially useful when you want to understand the impact of individual attributes on the concept hierarchy.

For contexts under 20×20, any of these methods will complete quickly, with the Next Closure algorithm generally being the most computationally efficient.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Operations** approach since it's the most straightforward to implement and understand for a context of this size (8 objects × 8 attributes).

Let me create an interactive tool that will extract all the lattice concepts from your CSV file:

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Operations** approach to extract all formal concepts from your CSV file. The tool:

1. **Loads and parses** your CSV data into a binary context matrix
2. **Enumerates all possible object subsets** (from empty set to full set)
3. **Computes closure operations** for each subset:
   - Finds shared attributes (intent) for each object subset
   - Finds all objects having those attributes (extent) 
   - Checks if the closure condition holds (original objects = closure)
4. **Identifies valid formal concepts** where the closure condition is satisfied
5. **Displays results** showing both the extent (objects) and intent (attributes) for each concept

The algorithm systematically checks all 2^8 = 256 possible object subsets and finds the ones that form valid formal concepts through the Galois connection between objects and attributes.

You can see the original context matrix visualization along with all extracted formal concepts, sorted by size for better readability. Each concept shows exactly which objects share which attributes in your formal context.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! I've added a section that displays all the formal concepts in your requested format. The tool now shows a formatted single-line list of all concepts where each concept is represented as `[intent, extent]` (attributes first, then objects), without quotation marks, exactly as you specified.

The format will be: `[[intent1, extent1], [intent2, extent2], ...]` where:
- Each concept is `[list_of_attributes, list_of_objects]`
- Empty sets are shown as `[]`
- No quotation marks around the attribute/object names
