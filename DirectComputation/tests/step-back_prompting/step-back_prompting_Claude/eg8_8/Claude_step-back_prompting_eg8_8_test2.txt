PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three effective methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

## 1. NextClosure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most widely used method for systematically generating all formal concepts. The algorithm works by:

- Starting with the empty set and computing its closure
- Iteratively finding the lexicographically next closed set using a specific increment operation
- Each closed set corresponds to the intent of a formal concept
- The algorithm guarantees to find all concepts without duplicates

For small contexts, this method is very efficient and produces concepts in a canonical order. It's particularly good because it avoids generating the same concept multiple times.

## 2. Intersection-Based Approach

This method leverages the mathematical property that concept intents are exactly the intersections of object attribute sets:

- Take all possible intersections of the attribute sets of individual objects
- Each non-empty intersection that cannot be expressed as a union of proper subsets represents a concept intent
- Compute the corresponding extent for each intent by finding all objects that have all attributes in the intent
- This approach works well for small contexts where you can enumerate all intersections

## 3. Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection

This straightforward method uses the basic definition of formal concepts:

- Systematically examine all possible subsets of objects (or attributes)
- For each subset A of objects, compute A' (the set of attributes common to all objects in A)
- Then compute A'' to get the corresponding object set
- If A = A'', then (A, A') is a formal concept
- Alternatively, start with attribute subsets and apply the dual process

While this has exponential worst-case complexity, it's perfectly manageable for contexts under 20×20 and has the advantage of being conceptually simple to implement and understand.

For contexts of your specified size, any of these methods will work efficiently, with NextClosure being the most elegant from a computational perspective.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection** method since it's the most straightforward to implement and visualize for this 8×8 context. Let me create an interactive tool that will systematically find all formal concepts.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Galois Connection** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. Here's how it works:

## The Algorithm:

1. **Enumerate all object subsets**: The algorithm systematically examines all 2^8 = 256 possible subsets of the 8 objects
2. **Apply Galois operators**: For each subset A of objects:
   - Compute A' = attributes common to all objects in A
   - Compute A'' = objects that have all attributes in A'
3. **Check formal concept condition**: If A = A'', then (A, A') is a formal concept
4. **Collect results**: All valid concept pairs are stored and displayed

## Key Features:

- **Visual context display**: Shows the original formal context with crosses (×) marking the incidence relation
- **Step-by-step processing**: Real-time progress indicator showing which subset is being processed
- **Organized output**: Concepts are sorted by extent size and clearly show both objects (extent) and attributes (intent)
- **Complete enumeration**: Guarantees finding all formal concepts without duplicates

Click "Extract All Concepts" to run the algorithm and see all the formal concepts in your context. The method is perfect for this size of context and will systematically find every concept pair (extent, intent) that satisfies the formal concept definition.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! I've updated the tool to display all concepts in the exact format you requested. Now when you click "Extract All Concepts", you'll see:

1. **The single line format** you requested: `[[intent], [extent]]` pairs without quotation marks
2. **The detailed breakdown** showing each concept individually for reference

The format follows your specification exactly:
- Each concept is represented as `[[attributes], [objects]]`
- All concepts are in a single array
- No quotation marks around the names
- Clean, copy-pasteable format

Click the "Extract All Concepts" button to generate the complete list in your requested format!
