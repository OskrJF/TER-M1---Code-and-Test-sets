PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three effective methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

## 1. Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators

For small contexts, you can systematically enumerate all possible attribute sets and compute their closures. Start with the empty set and progressively build larger attribute combinations:

- Compute the closure of each attribute subset A by finding all objects that have all attributes in A
- Then find all attributes shared by those objects (this gives you the formal concept)
- A pair (X, Y) is a formal concept if X is the set of objects sharing all attributes in Y, and Y is the set of attributes shared by all objects in X

This brute-force approach is feasible for small contexts and guarantees you find all concepts.

## 2. Next-Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most widely used algorithm for concept generation in FCA. It generates concepts in lexicographic order without creating duplicates:

- Start with the empty attribute set and compute its closure
- Use a systematic way to generate the "next" attribute set in lexicographic order
- For each new set, compute its closure to get the formal concept
- The algorithm ensures each concept is generated exactly once

This method is particularly efficient for contexts with moderate density and works well within your size constraints.

## 3. Incremental Construction

Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object at a time:

- Start with the context containing only the first object
- Generate all concepts for this single-object context
- When adding the next object, update the existing concept lattice by merging concepts where appropriate
- Continue until all objects are processed

This approach is intuitive and allows you to see how the lattice structure evolves as you add objects. It's especially useful when you want to understand the contribution of each object to the final lattice structure.

For contexts of your specified size, any of these methods will work efficiently, with the next-closure algorithm generally being the most computationally optimal.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators** method since it's the most straightforward to demonstrate and verify for this small context. Let me create an interactive tool that will systematically find all formal concepts.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. Here's how it works:

**The Algorithm:**
1. **Generate all attribute subsets**: Creates all 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of attributes {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}
2. **Apply closure operators**: For each attribute subset A:
   - Find all objects that have ALL attributes in A (this gives the extent)
   - Find all attributes shared by ALL those objects (this gives the intent)
3. **Verify formal concepts**: A pair (extent, intent) is a formal concept if it satisfies the Galois connection property
4. **Remove duplicates**: Since different attribute subsets can lead to the same concept

Click the "Extract All Formal Concepts" button to see the algorithm in action. It will show you the step-by-step process and then display all the formal concepts found in your context.

This method is particularly good for small contexts because:
- It's guaranteed to find ALL concepts
- It's easy to understand and verify manually
- The computational complexity is manageable for your 5×5 context
- You can see exactly how each concept is derived

The tool will show you both the extent (set of objects) and intent (set of attributes) for each formal concept, which together form the complete concept lattice structure.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
I've updated the tool to display the concepts in your requested format. Click the "Extract All Formal Concepts" button and you'll see a highlighted section showing all concepts in the exact format you requested: `[[[intent], [extent]], [[intent], [extent]], ...]` where intent is the list of attributes and extent is the list of objects, all without quotation marks.

The tool will process all 32 possible attribute subsets and find all the formal concepts in your 5×5 context, then display them both in the requested single-line format and in a more readable detailed view below.

[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[], []]]
