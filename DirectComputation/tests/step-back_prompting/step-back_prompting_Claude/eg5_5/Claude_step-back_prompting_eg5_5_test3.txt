PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three practical methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts:

## 1. NextClosure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most widely used algorithm for concept generation. It systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures of attribute sets in lexicographic order. The algorithm ensures each concept is generated exactly once by using a "next closure" operation that finds the lexicographically next closed set.

**Process:**
- Start with the empty attribute set
- Compute its closure (all objects sharing those attributes, then all attributes shared by those objects)
- Generate the next closure in lexicographic order
- Continue until all concepts are found

**Advantages:** Guaranteed to find all concepts without duplicates, memory efficient for small contexts.

## 2. Godin's Incremental Algorithm

This method builds the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object at a time to the context. For each new object, it updates the existing lattice structure by creating new concepts and modifying the hierarchy relationships.

**Process:**
- Start with an empty context and empty lattice
- Add objects one by one
- For each new object, identify which existing concepts it intersects with
- Create new concepts as needed and update the lattice structure
- Maintain the hierarchical relationships throughout

**Advantages:** Particularly useful when the context is being built dynamically or when you want to understand how each object contributes to the lattice structure.

## 3. Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation

For very small contexts (your size constraints make this feasible), you can enumerate all possible attribute subsets and compute their closures directly, then filter for actual concepts.

**Process:**
- Generate all 2^n possible attribute combinations
- For each combination, compute the closure: find all objects having those attributes, then find all attributes shared by those objects
- A set is a concept if it equals its own closure
- Build the lattice by establishing subset relationships between concepts

**Advantages:** Conceptually simple, easy to implement, works well for contexts under 20×20 where the search space is manageable.

For your size constraints (< 20 objects and attributes), any of these methods will perform well, with NextClosure being the most commonly implemented in FCA software tools.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation** method since it's conceptually straightforward and works well for small contexts like this one. Let me implement it to extract all lattice concepts from your CSV file.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV context. The tool:

1. **Parses your CSV file** and converts it into a binary context matrix
2. **Generates all possible attribute subsets** (2^5 = 32 combinations for your 5 attributes)
3. **Computes the closure** for each subset by finding:
   - All objects that have ALL attributes in the subset (extent)
   - All attributes shared by ALL those objects (intent)
4. **Identifies formal concepts** where the attribute set equals its computed intent
5. **Orders the results** by extent size for easier interpretation

Click the "Extract All Lattice Concepts" button to see all the formal concepts in your context. The results will show each concept with its extent (set of objects) and intent (set of attributes), along with processing statistics.

This method is perfect for your small context (5 objects × 5 attributes) as it systematically examines all possibilities and guarantees finding every formal concept in the lattice.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! Now when you click "Extract All Lattice Concepts", the tool will display the results in exactly the format you requested - a single line with all concepts formatted as `[[intent], [extent]]` pairs without quotation marks. The formatted output will appear at the top of the results section, followed by the detailed view for reference.

[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
