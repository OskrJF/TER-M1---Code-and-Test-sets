PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three practical methods for finding lattice concepts in small formal contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

## 1. Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators

For small contexts, you can systematically enumerate all possible object sets and compute their closures. Start with the empty set and single objects, then build up larger combinations:

- For each subset A of objects, compute A'' (the double prime closure)
- If A = A'', then (A, A') is a formal concept
- The extent is A and the intent is A' (all attributes shared by objects in A)

This brute-force approach is feasible for small contexts since you're dealing with at most 2^20 subsets to check.

## 2. Next Closure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is an efficient algorithm that generates concepts in lexicographic order without redundancy:

- Start with the empty attribute set
- For each current intent B, find the "next" intent by adding the smallest attribute that creates a proper closure
- Compute the extent by taking B' (all objects having all attributes in B)
- Continue until all concepts are generated

The algorithm ensures each concept is visited exactly once and is particularly efficient for contexts where many attribute combinations don't form valid closures.

## 3. Attribute Exploration with Incremental Construction

Build the concept lattice incrementally by processing one attribute at a time:

- Start with the concept lattice for the first few attributes
- For each new attribute, determine which existing concepts it splits or merges
- Add new concepts formed by the intersection of the new attribute with existing extents
- Update the lattice structure (covering relations) as you go

This method is intuitive and allows you to visualize how each attribute contributes to the final lattice structure. It's especially useful when you want to understand the role of individual attributes in forming the concept hierarchy.

For contexts of your specified size, any of these methods will complete in reasonable time, with the choice depending on whether you prioritize simplicity (method 1), efficiency (method 2), or interpretability (method 3).

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use **Method 1: Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators** since it's the most straightforward to implement and understand for this small context. Let me create a tool to extract all the lattice concepts from your CSV file.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Operators** method to extract all formal concepts from your CSV file. Here's how it works:

**The Algorithm:**
1. **Generate all object subsets**: Creates all 2^n possible combinations of objects (32 subsets for 5 objects)
2. **Compute closures**: For each subset A of objects:
   - Find A' (intent): all attributes shared by objects in A
   - Find A'' (extent): all objects that have all attributes in A'
3. **Identify concepts**: Keep only subsets where A = A'' (the closure condition)

**Key Features:**
- Displays the original formal context as a clear matrix
- Shows all discovered formal concepts with their extents and intents
- Provides statistics about the context and concept lattice
- Uses the standard FCA notation where Ã— indicates presence of an attribute

Click the "Extract Concepts from CSV" button to see all the formal concepts in your context. The tool will show you exactly which combinations of objects and attributes form valid concepts according to the mathematical definition in Formal Concept Analysis.

This method is perfect for your small context (5 objects, 5 attributes) and will give you the complete concept lattice foundation that you can then organize into a hierarchical structure if needed.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! Now when you click "Extract Concepts from CSV", the tool will display all the formal concepts in the exact format you requested - as a single line with the pattern `[[intent], [extent]]` for each concept, without quotation marks. The concepts will be shown both in the requested single-line format and individually for easier reading.

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]]]
