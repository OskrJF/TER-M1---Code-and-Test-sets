PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three practical methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts (under 20 objects and attributes):

**1. NextClosure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)**
This is the most efficient canonical method for small contexts. It systematically generates all formal concepts by computing closures in lexicographic order. The algorithm uses the closure operator to find concept extents, then derives the corresponding intents. For contexts under 20×20, it's very manageable and guarantees you won't miss any concepts or generate duplicates. You iterate through all possible attribute combinations, but only those that form valid closures become concepts.

**2. Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation**
For very small contexts, you can manually or programmatically check all possible subsets of objects and attributes. For each subset of objects, compute its intent (common attributes), then compute the extent of that intent (objects having all those attributes). If you get back your original object set, you've found a formal concept. This brute-force approach becomes computationally expensive around 15-20 elements but works well for smaller cases and helps build intuition.

**3. Incremental Construction**
Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object at a time to the context. Start with an empty context and its trivial lattice, then systematically add objects. For each new object, determine which existing concepts it modifies - some concepts may merge, new concepts may emerge, and the lattice structure updates accordingly. This approach is particularly useful when you're building contexts dynamically or want to understand how each object contributes to the final lattice structure.

The NextClosure algorithm is generally preferred for computational efficiency, while direct enumeration helps with understanding the theoretical foundations.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation** method since it's most suitable for this very small context (only 2 objects and 9 attributes) and will clearly show the step-by-step process.

Let me create a tool to analyze this FCA context and extract all formal concepts:

I've chosen the **Direct Enumeration with Closure Computation** method for this small context. This approach is perfect for your 2×9 context because:

1. **It's comprehensive** - systematically checks all possible object subsets
2. **It's educational** - clearly shows how each concept is derived
3. **It's manageable** - with only 2 objects, we have just 4 possible subsets to check

The tool will:
- Parse your CSV context data
- Display the formal context in a clear table format
- Generate all possible object subsets: {∅}, {o1}, {o2}, {o1,o2}
- For each subset, compute its intent (common attributes) and then the extent of that intent
- Apply the closure test to identify valid formal concepts
- Present all discovered concepts with their extents and intents

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! I've updated the tool to include a formatted output section that will display all the formal concepts in exactly the format you requested: `[[intent], [extent]]` for each concept, all in a single line without quotation marks.

The tool will now show both the detailed concept analysis and the clean formatted output you need. Click "Extract All Formal Concepts" to see the results in your specified format!
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]
