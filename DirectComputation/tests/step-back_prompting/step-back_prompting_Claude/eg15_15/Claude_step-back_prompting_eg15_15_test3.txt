PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes
____________________

OUTPUT:
Here are three practical methods for finding lattice concepts in small FCA contexts:

## 1. NextClosure Algorithm (Ganter's Algorithm)

This is the most widely used algorithm for concept enumeration. It systematically generates all formal concepts by iterating through attribute sets in lexicographic order. For each attribute set, it computes the closure and checks if it's canonical (the lexicographically smallest generator of that closure). The algorithm guarantees that each concept is found exactly once.

**Advantages**: Memory efficient, generates concepts in a systematic order, avoids duplicates
**Time complexity**: O(|G| × |M| × |B|) where B is the set of all concepts

## 2. Direct Enumeration via Galois Connection

This straightforward approach explicitly uses the Galois operators (↑ and ↓). You can either:
- Start with all possible object sets, apply (↑↓) to get their closures, then check which ones are actual extents
- Start with all possible attribute sets, apply (↓↑) to get their closures, then check which ones are actual intents

For small contexts, you can enumerate all 2^|G| object subsets (or 2^|M| attribute subsets) and compute their images under the Galois connection.

**Advantages**: Conceptually simple, easy to implement and understand
**Disadvantages**: Can generate many duplicates that need filtering

## 3. Incremental Construction

Build the concept lattice incrementally by adding one object (or attribute) at a time. Start with the empty context, then for each new object, determine which existing concepts are affected and how they split or merge. This method is particularly useful when you want to understand how the lattice structure evolves.

**Advantages**: Good for understanding lattice dynamics, can be stopped early if only partial results are needed
**Implementation**: Maintain the current set of concepts and update them as each new object/attribute is processed

For contexts with fewer than 20 objects and attributes, any of these methods will be computationally feasible, with the NextClosure algorithm generally being the most efficient for complete enumeration.

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll use the **Direct Enumeration via Galois Connection** method since it's conceptually straightforward and easy to implement for this size of context. This approach will systematically find all formal concepts by exploring attribute combinations and computing their corresponding object sets.

I've implemented the **Direct Enumeration via Galois Connection** method to extract all formal concepts from your FCA context. Here's how it works:

## Algorithm Overview:

1. **Generate Power Set**: Creates all possible combinations of attributes (2^15 = 32,768 combinations)

2. **Compute Galois Operators**: For each attribute combination:
   - **Extent (↓)**: Find all objects that have ALL attributes in the set
   - **Intent (↑)**: Find all attributes shared by ALL objects in the extent

3. **Verify Closure Property**: Check if (extent↑)↓ = extent and (intent↓)↑ = intent to ensure it's a valid formal concept

4. **Remove Duplicates**: Use intent signatures to avoid processing the same concept multiple times

## Key Features:

- **Visual Context Display**: Shows the original 15×15 binary relation with color-coded Yes/No values
- **Complete Concept Enumeration**: Finds all formal concepts systematically
- **Detailed Output**: Each concept shows both extent (objects) and intent (attributes)
- **Statistics**: Displays total number of concepts found
- **Sorted Results**: Concepts are ordered by extent size (largest first) then intent size

Click "Load & Process FCA Context" to see all the formal concepts extracted from your CSV data. The algorithm will process all 32,768 possible attribute combinations and identify which ones form valid formal concepts according to the Galois connection closure properties.

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Perfect! I've updated the interface to display all formal concepts in the exact single-line format you requested. The format is:

**[[intent], [extent]], [[intent], [extent]], ...**

Where:
- Each concept is represented as `[[intent], [extent]]`
- Intent contains the attributes (Attr1, Attr2, etc.)
- Extent contains the objects (O1, O2, etc.)
- Empty sets are shown as `[]`
- No quotation marks around the elements

The tool now shows:
1. **Single Line Format** - The complete list in your requested format with a copy button
2. **Detailed View** - Individual concepts with visual formatting for easier reading

Click "Load & Process FCA Context" to generate and see all the formal concepts from your 15×15 context in the exact format you specified. You can then copy the single-line result directly to use elsewhere.
