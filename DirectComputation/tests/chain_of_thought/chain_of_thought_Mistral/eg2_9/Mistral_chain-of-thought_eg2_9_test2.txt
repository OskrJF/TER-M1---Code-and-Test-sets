PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in the next context by following these steps
Objet;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9
o1;yes;yes;yes;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes
o2;yes;no;no;yes;no;yes;no;no;yes

1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
To find all the lattice concepts in the given context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we will follow the steps you've outlined. Let's start by implementing these steps in code.The formal concepts found in the given context are:

1. **Concept 1**:
   - Extent: \(\{\}\)
   - Intent: \(\{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9\}\)

2. **Concept 2**:
   - Extent: \(\{o1\}\)
   - Intent: \(\{a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9\}\)

3. **Concept 3**:
   - Extent: \(\{o2\}\)
   - Intent: \(\{a1, a4, a6, a9\}\)

4. **Concept 4**:
   - Extent: \(\{o1, o2\}\)
   - Intent: \(\{a1, a4, a9\}\)

These pairs of object subsets and their corresponding shared attributes represent the formal concepts in the given formal context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]
