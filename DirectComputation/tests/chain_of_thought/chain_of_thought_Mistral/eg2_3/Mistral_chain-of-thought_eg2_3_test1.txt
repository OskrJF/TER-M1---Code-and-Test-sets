PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in the next context by following these steps
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
To find all the lattice concepts in the given context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we will follow the steps you outlined. Let's start by building the binary relationship matrix from the provided data.

### Step 1: Build the Binary Relationship Matrix

The given context is:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| no |
| o2    | no | yes| yes|

We can represent this as a binary matrix where "yes" is 1 and "no" is 0:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| o2    | 0  | 1  | 1  |

### Step 2: Make a List of Every Possible Subset of the Objects

The objects are o1 and o2. The possible subsets of objects are:

1. Empty set: {}
2. {o1}
3. {o2}
4. {o1, o2}

### Step 3: Determine the Intent for Each Candidate Object Subset

For each subset, we determine the set of attributes shared by all objects in the subset.

1. **Subset: {}**
   - Intent: All attributes (since the empty set trivially shares all attributes)
   - Intent B: {a1, a2, a3}

2. **Subset: {o1}**
   - Intent: Attributes shared by o1
   - Intent B: {a1, a2}

3. **Subset: {o2}**
   - Intent: Attributes shared by o2
   - Intent B: {a2, a3}

4. **Subset: {o1, o2}**
   - Intent: Attributes shared by both o1 and o2
   - Intent B: {a2}

### Step 4: Find the Derived Set of Objects for Each Intent

For each intent, find all objects that possess every attribute in the intent.

1. **Intent: {a1, a2, a3}**
   - Objects with all attributes: {}
   - A_prime: {}

2. **Intent: {a1, a2}**
   - Objects with attributes a1 and a2: {o1}
   - A_prime: {o1}

3. **Intent: {a2, a3}**
   - Objects with attributes a2 and a3: {o2}
   - A_prime: {o2}

4. **Intent: {a2}**
   - Objects with attribute a2: {o1, o2}
   - A_prime: {o1, o2}

### Step 5: Check if A = A_prime

1. **Subset: {}**
   - A: {}
   - A_prime: {}
   - Concept: ({}, {a1, a2, a3})

2. **Subset: {o1}**
   - A: {o1}
   - A_prime: {o1}
   - Concept: ({o1}, {a1, a2})

3. **Subset: {o2}**
   - A: {o2}
   - A_prime: {o2}
   - Concept: ({o2}, {a2, a3})

4. **Subset: {o1, o2}**
   - A: {o1, o2}
   - A_prime: {o1, o2}
   - Concept: ({o1, o2}, {a2})

### Step 6: Collect All Unique Concepts

The unique formal concepts found are:

1. ({}, {a1, a2, a3})
2. ({o1}, {a1, a2})
3. ({o2}, {a2, a3})
4. ({o1, o2}, {a2})

These are the lattice concepts in the given context.
