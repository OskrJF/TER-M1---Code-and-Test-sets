PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in the next context by following these steps
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
To find all the lattice concepts in the given context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we'll follow the steps you've outlined. Let's start by building the binary relationship matrix from the provided data.

### Step 1: Build the Binary Relationship Matrix

The given context is:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| no |
| o2    | no | yes| yes|

We can represent this as a binary matrix where `yes` is represented as `1` and `no` as `0`:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| o2    | 0  | 1  | 1  |

### Step 2: List of All Possible Subsets of Objects

The objects are `o1` and `o2`. The list of all possible subsets of objects (including the empty set) is:

1. Empty set: `{}`
2. `{o1}`
3. `{o2}`
4. `{o1, o2}`

### Step 3: Determine the Intent for Each Candidate Object Subset

We'll go through each subset and determine the intent (set of shared attributes).

1. **Subset A = `{}` (Empty set)**
   - Intent B: All attributes are shared by all objects in the empty set (vacuously true). So, B = `{a1, a2, a3}`.
   - A_prime: Objects that possess all attributes in B. Since no object possesses all three attributes, A_prime = `{}`.
   - Since A = A_prime, `({}, {a1, a2, a3})` is a formal concept.

2. **Subset A = `{o1}`**
   - Intent B: Attributes shared by `o1` are `a1` and `a2`. So, B = `{a1, a2}`.
   - A_prime: Objects that possess all attributes in B. Only `o1` possesses both `a1` and `a2`. So, A_prime = `{o1}`.
   - Since A = A_prime, `({o1}, {a1, a2})` is a formal concept.

3. **Subset A = `{o2}`**
   - Intent B: Attributes shared by `o2` are `a2` and `a3`. So, B = `{a2, a3}`.
   - A_prime: Objects that possess all attributes in B. Only `o2` possesses both `a2` and `a3`. So, A_prime = `{o2}`.
   - Since A = A_prime, `({o2}, {a2, a3})` is a formal concept.

4. **Subset A = `{o1, o2}`**
   - Intent B: Attributes shared by both `o1` and `o2` is `a2`. So, B = `{a2}`.
   - A_prime: Objects that possess all attributes in B. Both `o1` and `o2` possess `a2`. So, A_prime = `{o1, o2}`.
   - Since A = A_prime, `({o1, o2}, {a2})` is a formal concept.

### Step 4: Collect All Unique Concepts

The formal concepts found are:

1. `({}, {a1, a2, a3})`
2. `({o1}, {a1, a2})`
3. `({o2}, {a2, a3})`
4. `({o1, o2}, {a2})`

These are all the lattice concepts in the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Based on the formal concepts we derived, here is the list in the requested format:

[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
