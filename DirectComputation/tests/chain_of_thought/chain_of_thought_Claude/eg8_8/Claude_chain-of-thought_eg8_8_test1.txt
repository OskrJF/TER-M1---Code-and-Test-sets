PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze the CSV file to find all formal concepts using the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) method. Let me start by reading and processing the data.

I've created a comprehensive Formal Concept Analysis tool that processes your CSV file step by step. Here's what the analysis reveals:

## Summary of the FCA Process:

**Step 1:** The binary relationship matrix shows 8 objects (O1-O8) and 8 attributes (a1-a8), where "Yes" means the object possesses the attribute.

**Steps 2-6:** The algorithm systematically:
- Generates all 256 possible subsets of objects (including the empty set)
- For each subset, finds the common attributes (intent)
- Derives the objects that have all those attributes (extent)
- Identifies formal concepts where the original subset equals the derived extent

## Key Findings:

The analysis discovers all formal concepts in your context. Each concept is a pair (A, B) where:
- A is the **extent** (set of objects)
- B is the **intent** (set of attributes)

The concepts form a complete lattice structure, with:
- The **top concept** having all objects but only attributes common to all
- The **bottom concept** having all attributes but only objects possessing all of them
- Intermediate concepts representing various object-attribute relationships

This FCA analysis is particularly useful for:
- Knowledge representation
- Data mining
- Conceptual clustering
- Understanding hierarchical relationships in your data

The interactive visualization shows the complete binary matrix and all discovered formal concepts, making it easy to understand the lattice structure of your dataset.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
The tool now displays the complete list of all formal concepts in the exact format you requested. The analysis will show all concepts as pairs of [intent, extent] where:
- The first array contains the attributes (intent)
- The second array contains the objects (extent)

The formatted output appears in a highlighted box showing the complete concept list in a single line without quotation marks, exactly as you specified: `[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], ...`

[[[a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8], []], [[a1,a2,a3,a6,a8], [O2]], [[a1,a2,a4,a6], [O3]], [[a1,a2,a6], [O2,O3]], [[a2,a3,a4,a5,a8], [O4]], [[a2,a3,a8], [O2,O4]], [[a2,a4,a6,a7,a8], [O5]], [[a2,a6,a8], [O2,O5]], [[a2,a4,a6], [O3,O5]], [[a2,a6], [O2,O3,O5]], [[a2,a4,a8], [O4,O5]], [[a2,a8], [O2,O4,O5]], [[a1,a2,a3,a5,a7], [O6]], [[a1,a2,a3], [O1,O2,O6]], [[a1,a2], [O1,O2,O3,O6]], [[a2,a3,a4,a5,a7], [O7,O8]], [[a2,a3,a4,a5], [O4,O7,O8]], [[a2,a4,a7], [O5,O7,O8]], [[a2,a4], [O3,O4,O5,O7,O8]], [[a2,a3,a5,a7], [O6,O7,O8]], [[a2,a3,a5], [O4,O6,O7,O8]], [[a2,a3], [O1,O2,O4,O6,O7,O8]], [[a2,a7], [O5,O6,O7,O8]], [[a2], [O1,O2,O3,O4,O5,O6,O7,O8]]]Â
