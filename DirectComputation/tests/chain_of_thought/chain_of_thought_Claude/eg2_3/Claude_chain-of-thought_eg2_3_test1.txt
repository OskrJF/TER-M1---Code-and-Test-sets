PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze the CSV file to find all lattice concepts in this formal concept analysis context. Let me start by reading and parsing the data.

I've completed the formal concept analysis following the systematic steps you outlined. Here's what I found:

## Summary of the Analysis:

**Step 1**: I converted the CSV data into a binary relationship matrix where "yes" = 1 and "no" = 0.

**Step 2**: I generated all possible subsets of objects {o1, o2}: ∅, {o1}, {o2}, {o1, o2}.

**Steps 3-6**: For each candidate subset, I:
- Found the intent (shared attributes)
- Derived the extent from that intent
- Checked if the original subset equals the derived extent

## The 4 Formal Concepts Found:

1. **(∅, {a1, a2, a3})** - Empty extent with all attributes as intent
2. **({o1}, {a1, a2})** - Object o1 with attributes a1 and a2
3. **({o2}, {a2, a3})** - Object o2 with attributes a2 and a3  
4. **({o1, o2}, {a2})** - Both objects with their only shared attribute a2

The interactive analysis above shows the complete step-by-step verification process. Each formal concept represents a maximal rectangle of 1's in the binary matrix, where you cannot add more objects or attributes without breaking the concept property (A = A').

These four concepts form the concept lattice for this formal context, with the partial order defined by subset inclusion of extents (equivalently, reverse subset inclusion of intents).

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
