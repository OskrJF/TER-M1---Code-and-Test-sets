PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I'll help you perform formal concept analysis (FCA) on this CSV file. Let me start by reading and analyzing the data systematically.

I've created a comprehensive formal concept analysis of your CSV file. Let me walk you through what was found:

## Summary of Results

The analysis identified **6 formal concepts** from the binary context with 5 objects (o1-o5) and 5 attributes (a1-a5):

### The 6 Formal Concepts:

1. **Concept 1**: (∅, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}) - Empty extent with all attributes
2. **Concept 2**: ({o2}, {a3}) - Object o2 alone with attribute a3
3. **Concept 3**: ({o5}, {a2}) - Object o5 alone with attribute a2  
4. **Concept 4**: ({o4, o5}, {a2}) - Objects o4 and o5 sharing attribute a2
5. **Concept 5**: ({o1, o3}, {a1, a4}) - Objects o1 and o3 sharing attributes a1 and a4
6. **Concept 6**: ({o1, o2, o3}, {}) - Objects o1, o2, o3 with no shared attributes

## Key Findings:

- **Object o2** forms a unique concept because it's the only object that has attribute a3 but lacks a1, a2, a4, and a5
- **Object o5** forms a unique concept as it only has attribute a2
- **Objects o4 and o5** together form a concept sharing only attribute a2
- **Objects o1 and o3** form a concept sharing attributes a1 and a4
- The **top concept** (∅, {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}) represents the case where no objects share all attributes
- The **bottom concept** ({o1,o2,o3}, ∅) represents objects that share no common attributes

The interactive visualization above shows the complete step-by-step analysis, including the binary matrix, all 32 possible object subsets, and the detailed verification process for each potential concept. Each formal concept represents a maximal rectangle of 1's in the binary relation matrix when properly ordered.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Looking at the formal concepts I found in the analysis, here they are in the requested format:

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o5]], [[a2], [o4, o5]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[], [o1, o2, o3]]]
