PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I'll help you find all the lattice concepts in this CSV file using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). Let me start by reading and analyzing the data.

I've created a complete Formal Concept Analysis that follows all the steps you outlined. Here's what the analysis reveals:

**Step 1: Binary Relationship Matrix**
The CSV data shows two objects (o1, o2) with nine attributes (a1-a9), converted to a binary matrix where 1 = "yes" and 0 = "no".

**Step 2: All Possible Object Subsets**
There are 4 possible subsets: ∅ (empty), {o1}, {o2}, {o1, o2}

**Steps 3-5: Finding Formal Concepts**
For each candidate subset A:
- Find intent B (attributes shared by all objects in A)
- Find extent A' (all objects having all attributes in B)
- Check if A = A' to determine if it's a formal concept

**Step 6: Final Results**
The analysis found **4 formal concepts**:

1. **Concept 1**: (∅, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}) - Empty extent with all attributes
2. **Concept 2**: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}) - Object o1 with its unique attribute combination
3. **Concept 3**: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9}) - Object o2 with its unique attribute combination  
4. **Concept 4**: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9}) - Both objects with their common attributes

These concepts form the concept lattice for this formal context. Each concept represents a maximal rectangle in the binary relation matrix, where the extent contains all objects sharing the attributes in the intent, and the intent contains all attributes shared by the objects in the extent.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Based on the formal concept analysis, here is the list of all concepts in the requested single line format:

[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]
