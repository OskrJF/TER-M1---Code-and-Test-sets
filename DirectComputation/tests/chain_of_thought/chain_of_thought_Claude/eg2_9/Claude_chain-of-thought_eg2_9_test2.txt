PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I'll help you perform Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) on the provided CSV file. Let me start by reading and analyzing the data.

I've performed a complete Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) on your CSV file following the exact steps you outlined. Here's what the analysis found:

## Summary of Results

The analysis identified **4 formal concepts** from the given context:

1. **Concept 1**: (∅, {a1, a4, a9})
   - Empty extent with attributes shared by all objects in the context

2. **Concept 2**: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})
   - Object o1 with its unique combination of attributes

3. **Concept 3**: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})
   - Object o2 with its unique combination of attributes

4. **Concept 4**: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})
   - Both objects with only the attributes they share in common

## Key Insights

- The **top concept** (∅, {a1, a4, a9}) represents the attributes that are common to all objects in the context
- The **bottom concept** ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9}) represents all objects with only their shared attributes
- Each individual object forms its own concept with its complete set of attributes
- Attributes a1, a4, and a9 are possessed by both objects, making them the "core" attributes of this context

The interactive visualization above shows the complete step-by-step process, including the binary relationship matrix, all possible object subsets, and the detailed analysis for each candidate concept.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Based on the Formal Concept Analysis performed on your CSV file, here are all the concepts in the requested format:

[[a1, a4, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]
