PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can help you with that! I will prepare a Python script that implements the steps you've outlined to find all formal concepts in the provided CSV data.

The script will:

    Parse the CSV data to build the binary relationship matrix (the formal context).
    Generate all possible subsets of objects.
    For each subset A, calculate its intent B.
    From intent B, calculate the derived extent A_prime.
    If A equals A_prime, then (A, B) is identified as a formal concept.
    Finally, it will collect and display all unique formal concepts found.

Here's the Python script:
Formal Concept Analysis from CSV

I've embedded the Python script above. It includes the CSV data directly and performs the analysis as requested. When executed, it will print the list of objects, attributes, the context map, and then the list of all formal concepts found, with extents and intents clearly indicated.

The concepts are stored as pairs of frozensets to ensure uniqueness and allow them to be added to a set. The output is sorted for easier readability.

You can copy this code into a Python interpreter or a .py file and run it to see the results. Let me know if you have any questions!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
List of all concepts in the required single-line format:
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a3], [o1, o2]]]
