Context file: eg5_5
Type of solution: Applied code
Created .txt file?: No
Test number: 1

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
I have implemented the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) based on the steps you provided.
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) Lattice Concepts

The Python script first reads the provided CSV data, converts it into a binary relationship matrix, and then systematically identifies all formal concepts. It generates all possible subsets of objects, calculates their corresponding intents, and then determines their extents. If an object subset matches its derived extent, it's identified as a formal concept.

The output displays the binary matrix, the list of objects and attributes, and then lists all the unique formal concepts found, showing their extent (objects) and intent (attributes).

Let me know if you'd like any modifications or further analysis!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]]]
