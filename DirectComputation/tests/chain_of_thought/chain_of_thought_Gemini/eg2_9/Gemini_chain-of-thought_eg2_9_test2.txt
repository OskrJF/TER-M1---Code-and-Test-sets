Context file: eg2_9
Type of solution: Applied code
Created .txt file?: No
Test number: 2

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
Okay, I've processed the CSV file you provided. It appears to have two objects, 'o1' and 'o2', and nine attributes, 'a1' through 'a9'. The presence of an attribute is marked by 'yes'.

I will now proceed to:

    Build the binary relationship matrix based on 'yes' indicating presence.
    Generate all possible subsets of the objects {o1, o2}.
    For each subset, determine its intent (shared attributes).
    From that intent, derive the extent (all objects sharing those attributes).
    Identify formal concepts where the initial object subset matches the derived extent.
    Collect and display all unique formal concepts.

I'll prepare a document to show you the binary matrix and the resulting formal concepts.
Formal Concept Analysis Results for eg2_9.csv

I have manually performed the steps of Formal Concept Analysis on the data from your eg2_9.csv file. The detailed breakdown, including the binary matrix and the derivation of each of the four formal concepts, is presented in the document above.

To summarize, the four formal concepts (Extent, Intent) found are:

    Extent: {} (no objects), Intent: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9} (all attributes)
    Extent: {o1}, Intent: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
    Extent: {o2}, Intent: {a1, a4, a6, a9}
    Extent: {o1, o2}, Intent: {a1, a4, a9}

This was done by:

    Representing your CSV data as a binary matrix where 'yes' means an object has an attribute.
    Considering every possible subset of objects (including the empty set).
    For each subset A, finding all attributes B shared by every object in A.
    Then, finding all objects A_prime that possess every attribute in B.
    If A and A_prime were the same, then (A, B) was recorded as a formal concept.

For a dataset of this small size (2 objects), this manual enumeration is feasible. For larger datasets, more optimized algorithms are typically used.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Okay, here is the list of all concepts in the requested single-line format:
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]]
