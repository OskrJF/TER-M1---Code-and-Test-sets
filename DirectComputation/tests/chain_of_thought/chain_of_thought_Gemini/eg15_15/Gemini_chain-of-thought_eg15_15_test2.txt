Gemini_chain-of-thought_eg15_15_test2

Date: 28 may 2025
Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro 
Context file: eg15_15
Type of solution: Applied code
Created .txt file?: No
Test number: 2

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can help you with that! I will provide a Python script that reads the specified CSV file, builds the binary relationship matrix, and then applies the algorithm you've outlined to find all formal concepts.

First, I need to understand the structure and content of your CSV file, eg15_15.csv. I'll fetch its content.
I apologize for that hiccup. It seems there was an issue with how I tried to access the file details.

Let's try fetching the content of eg15_15.csv again.
Okay, I have the content of your CSV file. Based on this, I've prepared a Python script that will perform the Formal Concept Analysis as you've described.

This script will:

    Use the provided CSV data directly.
    Parse this data to build a context: a list of objects, a list of attributes, and a mapping indicating which objects possess which attributes (where "Yes" signifies possession).
    Generate every possible subset of objects (these are your candidate extents).
    For each candidate object subset (A):
        Determine the set of attributes (B) shared by all objects in A (the intent).
        From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B (this is A').
    If the original candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set A', then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
    Collect all such unique formal concepts.
    Finally, it will print all the found concepts, with extents and intents sorted for consistent presentation.

Here is the Python script:
Formal Concept Analysis Script
28 mai, 23:34

This script includes the CSV data you provided directly within it. When you run this Python script, it will print out all the formal concepts it finds from that data. Each concept will be shown as a pair: an "Extent" (the set of objects) and an "Intent" (the set of attributes).

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any modifications!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
