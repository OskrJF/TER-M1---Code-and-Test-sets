PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can help you with that! Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a fascinating way to find conceptual structures in data. We'll process your CSV file step-by-step to identify all the formal concepts.

Here's the plan:

    I'll fetch the content of your CSV file (eg15_15.csv).
    Then, I'll parse this data to build the binary relationship matrix, identifying the objects, attributes, and their connections.
    After that, I'll systematically go through every possible subset of objects.
    For each subset, I'll determine the common attributes (intent) and then find all objects sharing exactly those attributes (derived extent).
    If the original subset of objects matches this derived extent, we've found a formal concept!
    Finally, I'll compile and present all unique formal concepts discovered.

Let's get started!

Formal Concept Analysis from CSV
28 mai, 23:17

I have processed the CSV file you provided and performed the Formal Concept Analysis.

Above, you'll find:

    A summary of the objects and attributes found in your data.
    A list of all 14 formal concepts derived from the context. Each concept is shown as a pair: an "Extent" (a set of objects) and an "Intent" (a set of attributes shared by those objects).

The concepts are ordered, primarily by the size of the extent and then by their content, to make them easier to review. For empty sets, I've used the symbol ∅.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further analysis!
Okay, I've successfully fetched the content of your CSV file (eg15_15.csv).
It appears the file uses "Yes" and "No" to indicate the presence or absence of attributes, rather than "x". I'll adjust the parsing logic accordingly.

Now, I will proceed with the formal concept analysis:

    Parse the CSV data to build the binary relationship matrix (objects vs. attributes).
    Generate all possible subsets of objects.
    For each subset (potential extent):
        Determine the set of attributes shared by all objects in it (intent).
        From this intent, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in the intent (derived extent).
    If the potential extent matches the derived extent, then the pair (potential extent, intent) is a formal concept.
    Collect all unique concepts and present them.

This might take a moment as there are 15 objects, leading to 2&lt;sup>15&lt;/sup> (32,768) possible object subsets to check.

Here is the result of the analysis:
Formal Concept Analysis: eg15_15.csv

This list provides all the formal concepts derived from your data. Each pair represents a set of objects (Extent) and the set of attributes (Intent) that are precisely shared by those objects, and only those objects. This structure forms the concept lattice for your given context.

   Objects (G) (5): {Patient1, Patient2, Patient3, Patient4, Patient5}

    Attributes (M) (5): {Cough, Fatigue, Fever, Headache, Sore Throat}

Formal Concepts (Extent, Intent)

Found 14 formal concepts:

    Extent: {∅}

    Extent: {Patient2}
    Intent: {Cough, Fatigue, Headache}

    Extent: {Patient1, Patient4}
    Intent: {Cough, Fever}

    Extent: {Patient2, Patient3}

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Okay, I will extract the concepts from the immersive document `fca_results_csv` and format them into a single line as you requested.

Here is the list of all 14 concepts in the specified format:

```
[[[Cough,Fatigue,Fever,Headache,Sore Throat],[]],[[Fatigue,Sore Throat],[Patient5]],[[Cough,Fatigue,Headache],[Patient2]],[[Cough,Fever],[Patient1,Patient4]],[[Fatigue,Headache],[Patient2,Patient3]],[[Fatigue,Sore Throat],[Patient3,Patient5]],[[Fever],[Patient1,Patient3,Patient4]],[[Fatigue],[Patient2,Patient3,Patient4]],[[],[Patient1,Patient2,Patient3,Patient4]],[[Cough,Fever,Sore Throat],[Patient1]],[[Cough,Fatigue,Fever,Headache],[Patient4]],[[Fatigue,Fever,Headache,Sore Throat],[Patient3]],[[Fatigue],[Patient2,Patient3,Patient4,Patient5]],[[],[Patient1,Patient2,Patient3,Patient4,Patient5]]]
