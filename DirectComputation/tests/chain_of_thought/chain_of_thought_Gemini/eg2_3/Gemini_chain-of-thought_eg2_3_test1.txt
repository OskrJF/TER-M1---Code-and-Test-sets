PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
kay, I can help you find all the formal concepts from your CSV file. I will follow the steps you've outlined.

First, I need to access the content of your CSV file, eg2_3.csv.
My apologies, it seems I made an error in my previous attempt to access your file. The field name for the file identifier was incorrect.

Let me try fetching the content of eg2_3.csv again with the correct parameter.
It seems I'm having a bit of trouble with the file access parameters. The API for fetching files is quite specific.

Let me try one more time to fetch eg2_3.csv, ensuring I use only the required fields for the SourceReference.
Okay, I have successfully fetched the content of your CSV file eg2_3.csv.
The content is:
Code snippet

Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

I will now proceed to find all formal concepts based on the steps you provided.

1. Build a binary relationship matrix (Formal Context)

From the CSV, we can identify:

    Objects (G): {o1, o2}
    Attributes (M): {a1, a2, a3}

The relationship "object possesses attribute" is as follows:

    o1 possesses attributes {a1, a2}
    o2 possesses attributes {a2, a3}

This can be represented as a context map:
context = {
'o1': {'a1', 'a2'},
'o2': {'a2', 'a3'}
}

2. Generate all possible subsets of objects (Candidate Extents)

The set of objects is G = {o1, o2}. The possible subsets (potential extents A) are:

    A₁ = {} (the empty set)
    A₂ = {o1}
    A₃ = {o2}
    A₄ = {o1, o2}

3-6. Determine Intents, Derive Extents, and Identify Formal Concepts

For each candidate extent A, we will:
a. Determine its intent B = A' (attributes common to all objects in A).
b. From B, derive the extent A_prime = B' (objects possessing all attributes in B).
c. If A = A_prime, then (A, B) is a formal concept.

Let's trace this for each candidate:

    Candidate 1: A = {}
        a. Intent B = A': The set of attributes common to all objects in {} is the set of all attributes. B = {a1, a2, a3}
        b. Derived Extent A_prime = B': Objects that possess a1 AND a2 AND a3.
            o1 has {a1, a2} (does not have a3)
            o2 has {a2, a3} (does not have a1) A_prime = {}
        c. Check: A == A_prime? {} == {}. Yes.
        Formal Concept 1: (Extent: {}, Intent: {a1, a2, a3})

    Candidate 2: A = {o1}
        a. Intent B = A': Attributes common to objects in {o1}. B = {a1, a2} (attributes of o1)
        b. Derived Extent A_prime = B': Objects that possess a1 AND a2.
            o1 has {a1, a2} (Yes)
            o2 has {a2, a3} (No, missing a1) A_prime = {o1}
        c. Check: A == A_prime? {o1} == {o1}. Yes.
        Formal Concept 2: (Extent: {o1}, Intent: {a1, a2})

    Candidate 3: A = {o2}
        a. Intent B = A': Attributes common to objects in {o2}. B = {a2, a3} (attributes of o2)
        b. Derived Extent A_prime = B': Objects that possess a2 AND a3.
            o1 has {a1, a2} (No, missing a3)
            o2 has {a2, a3} (Yes) A_prime = {o2}
        c. Check: A == A_prime? {o2} == {o2}. Yes.
        Formal Concept 3: (Extent: {o2}, Intent: {a2, a3})

    Candidate 4: A = {o1, o2}
        a. Intent B = A': Attributes common to objects in {o1, o2}.
            Attributes of o1: {a1, a2}
            Attributes of o2: {a2, a3}
            Common attributes: {a1, a2} ∩ {a2, a3} = {a2} B = {a2}
        b. Derived Extent A_prime = B': Objects that possess a2.
            o1 has {a1, a2} (Yes, has a2)
            o2 has {a2, a3} (Yes, has a2) A_prime = {o1, o2}
        c. Check: A == A_prime? {o1, o2} == {o1, o2}. Yes.
        Formal Concept 4: (Extent: {o1, o2}, Intent: {a2})
