Context file: eg2_3
Type of solution: Applied code
Created .txt file?: No
Test number: 2

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can help you with that! I will process the CSV file you provided to find all formal concepts using the steps you've outlined.

Here's the plan:

    I'll fetch the content of your CSV file (eg2_3.csv).
    Then, I'll construct the binary relationship matrix (the formal context) from this data, identifying the objects and their attributes.
    I will generate every possible subset of these objects.
    For each subset of objects (let's call it A): a. I'll determine the set of attributes (B) that are common to all objects in A. b. Then, I'll find all objects in the entire context (A_prime) that possess every attribute in B. c. If A is identical to A_prime, the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
    Finally, I'll collect all unique formal concepts found and present them to you.

This process can be computationally intensive if there are many objects, as the number of subsets grows exponentially.

Let's get started. I'll first fetch and parse your CSV file.
Okay, I've got the plan. I'll first fetch the content of your CSV file, eg2_3.csv. After that, I'll apply the Formal Concept Analysis algorithm as we discussed and prepare a report with the context overview and the list of formal concepts.

Let's fetch the file content first.
Okay, I have successfully fetched the content of your file eg2_3.csv.
The content is:
Code snippet

Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

I'll now proceed to build the binary relationship matrix, identify all object subsets, and apply the algorithm to find the formal concepts. I've adjusted my parser to recognize 'yes' as an indicator that an object possesses an attribute.

Here is the formal concept analysis:
Formal Concept Analysis of eg2_3.csv

I have generated the formal concepts based on the provided CSV file. The results include an overview of the objects and attributes found, the binary relationship matrix, and a list of all the formal concepts with their extents and intents.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Okay, here are the formal concepts from the document `fca_results_eg2_3` in the format you requested:

[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
