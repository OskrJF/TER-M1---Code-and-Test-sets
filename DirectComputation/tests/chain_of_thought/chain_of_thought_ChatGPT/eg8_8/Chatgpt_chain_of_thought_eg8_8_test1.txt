Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Let's compute **all formal concepts** from your latest formal context.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Parse the Context

#### Objects and their attributes:

* **O1** â†’ {a1, a2, a3}
* **O2** â†’ {a1, a2, a3, a6, a8}
* **O3** â†’ {a1, a2, a4, a6}
* **O4** â†’ {a2, a3, a4, a5, a8}
* **O5** â†’ {a2, a4, a6, a7, a8}
* **O6** â†’ {a1, a2, a3, a5, a7}
* **O7** â†’ {a2, a3, a4, a5, a7}
* **O8** â†’ {a2, a3, a4, a5, a7}

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Generate All Subsets of Objects (8 objects â†’ 256 subsets)

For each subset A:

* Compute **intent B** = attributes shared by all objects in A
* Compute **Aâ€²** = all objects having all attributes in B
* If **A = Aâ€²**, then (A, B) is a **formal concept**

### âœ… Final Answer â€” All Formal Concepts (single line format, no quotation marks):

```
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8], []], [[a1, a2, a3], [O1]], [[a1, a2, a3, a6, a8], [O2]], [[a1, a2, a4, a6], [O3]], [[a2, a3, a4, a5, a8], [O4]], [[a2, a4, a6, a7, a8], [O5]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5, a7], [O6]], [[a2, a3, a4, a5, a7], [O7, O8]], [[a2, a3, a4, a5, a7], [O8]]]
```

Let me know if you'd like to visualize the **concept lattice**, reduce redundancy, or export results.
