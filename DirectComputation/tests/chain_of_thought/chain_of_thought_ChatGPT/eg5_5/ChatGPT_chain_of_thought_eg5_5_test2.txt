Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concepts analysis (FCA), find all the lattice concepts in this .csv file with a context by following these steps
1. Build a binary relationship matrix from the file, indicating which objects possess which attributes
2. Make a list of every possible subset of the objects found in the CSV file, consider too the empty subsets. Each such subset is going to be considered a candidate for an "extent" of a formal concept
3. For the first candidate object subset A, determine the set of attributes B that are shared by all objects in the subset A. This set B is the "intent" corresponding to A.
4. From this set of attributes B, find all objects in the entire context that possess every attribute in B. Let's call this new set of objects A_prime.
5. If the candidate object subset A is identical to the derived set of objects A_prime (A = A_prime), then the pair (A, B) is a formal concept.
6. Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 for every subset of objects from step 2
4. Collect all unique concepts found through this process

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:

Thanks! Let's compute all **formal concepts** from this updated formal context.

### ðŸ”¹ Context Table (cleaned from your CSV):

| Objet | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a5  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| o1    | yes | no  | yes | yes | no  |
| o2    | no  | no  | yes | no  | no  |
| o3    | yes | yes | no  | yes | yes |
| o4    | no  | yes | no  | no  | yes |
| o5    | no  | yes | no  | no  | no  |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Object â†’ Attributes:

* o1 â†’ {a1, a3, a4}
* o2 â†’ {a3}
* o3 â†’ {a1, a2, a4, a5}
* o4 â†’ {a2, a5}
* o5 â†’ {a2}

---

### ðŸ”¹ Compute Formal Concepts

Using the closure operator: for each subset of objects $A$, compute:

* **Intent B** = attributes shared by all objects in $A$
* **Extent Aâ€²** = all objects that have every attribute in $B$
* If $A = Aâ€²$, then (A, B) is a formal concept

### âœ… Final List of All Formal Concepts (Single Line Format):

```
[[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a2, a5], [o4]], [[a2], [o5]]]
```

This list includes all **8 formal concepts** from your context. Let me know if youâ€™d like the lattice drawn or exported!
