PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and les than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given the next context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts:
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

OUTPUT:
To find the lattice concepts in the given formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we first need to understand the basic definitions:

1. **Formal Context**: A triplet \((G, M, I)\), where \(G\) is a set of objects, \(M\) is a set of attributes, and \(I\) is a binary relation between \(G\) and \(M\).

2. **Formal Concept**: A pair \((A, B)\), where \(A \subseteq G\), \(B \subseteq M\), \(A' = B\), and \(B' = A\). Here, \(A'\) is the set of attributes common to all objects in \(A\), and \(B'\) is the set of objects sharing all attributes in \(B\).

Given the context:

| Object | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|--------|----|----|----|
| o1     | yes| yes| no |
| o2     | no | yes| yes|

We can represent this context as:

- \(G = \{o1, o2\}\)
- \(M = \{a1, a2, a3\}\)
- \(I = \{(o1, a1), (o1, a2), (o2, a2), (o2, a3)\}\)

Now, let's find all the formal concepts:

1. **Concept 1**: \((\emptyset, \{a1, a2, a3\})\)
   - This is the top concept where no objects have all attributes.

2. **Concept 2**: \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)
   - Object \(o1\) has attributes \(a1\) and \(a2\).

3. **Concept 3**: \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)
   - Object \(o2\) has attributes \(a2\) and \(a3\).

4. **Concept 4**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)
   - Both objects \(o1\) and \(o2\) share attribute \(a2\).

5. **Concept 5**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \emptyset)\)
   - This is the bottom concept where all objects have no common attributes.

These are the formal concepts derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[], [o1, o2]]]
