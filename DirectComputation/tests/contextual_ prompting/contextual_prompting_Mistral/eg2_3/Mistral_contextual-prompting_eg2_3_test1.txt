PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and les than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given the next context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts:
Objet;a1;a2;a3
o1;yes;yes;no
o2;no;yes;yes

OUTPUT:
To find the lattice concepts in the given formal context using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), we need to identify all pairs of object sets and attribute sets that form concepts. A concept is a pair \((A, B)\), where \(A\) is a set of objects, \(B\) is a set of attributes, and the pair satisfies the following conditions:

1. All objects in \(A\) have all attributes in \(B\).
2. \(A\) is the maximal set of objects that have all attributes in \(B\).
3. \(B\) is the maximal set of attributes shared by all objects in \(A\).

Given the context:

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 |
|-------|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| no |
| o2    | no | yes| yes|

We can enumerate the concepts as follows:

1. **Concept 1**: \((\{\}, \{\})\)
   - This is the trivial concept with no objects and no attributes.

2. **Concept 2**: \((\{o1\}, \{a1, a2\})\)
   - Object \(o1\) has attributes \(a1\) and \(a2\).

3. **Concept 3**: \((\{o2\}, \{a2, a3\})\)
   - Object \(o2\) has attributes \(a2\) and \(a3\).

4. **Concept 4**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{a2\})\)
   - Both objects \(o1\) and \(o2\) share attribute \(a2\).

5. **Concept 5**: \((\{\}, \{a1\})\)
   - No objects have attribute \(a1\) exclusively.

6. **Concept 6**: \((\{\}, \{a2\})\)
   - No objects have attribute \(a2\) exclusively.

7. **Concept 7**: \((\{\}, \{a3\})\)
   - No objects have attribute \(a3\) exclusively.

8. **Concept 8**: \((\{o1, o2\}, \{\})\)
   - All objects with no attributes.

These are all the possible concepts that can be derived from the given context.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1], [o1]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []], [[], [o1, o2]]]
