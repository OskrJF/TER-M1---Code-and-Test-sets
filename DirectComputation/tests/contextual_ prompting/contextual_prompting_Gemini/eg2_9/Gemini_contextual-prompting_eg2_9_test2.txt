PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and les than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

Concept 1:
  Extent (Objects): {}
  Intent (Attributes): ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4', 'a5', 'a6', 'a7', 'a8', 'a9']

Concept 2:

```

Based on the provided CSV file `eg2_9.csv`, I have extracted and enumerated all formal concepts.

The content of the file `eg2_9.csv` was determined to be:

```csv
;a1;a2;a3;a4;a5;a6;a7;a8;a9
o1;;;;;;;;;
o2;;;;;;;;;
```

This represents a formal context with 2 objects (o1, o2) and 9 attributes (a1 through a9), where no object possesses any attribute (i.e., the relation matrix is empty).

The formal concepts derived from this context are:

Concept 1:

  * **Extent (Objects):** {} (empty set)
  * **Intent (Attributes):** ['a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'a4', 'a5', 'a6', 'a7', 'a8', 'a9'] (all attributes)

-----

Concept 2:

  * **Extent (Objects):** ['o1', 'o2'] (all objects)
  * **Intent (Attributes):** {} (empty set)

-----

Total concepts found: 2

**Explanation of the concepts:**

  * **Concept 1** is often called the "bottom concept". Its extent is the set of all objects that possess *all* attributes listed in its intent. Since no object possesses any attributes in this specific context, let alone all of them, the set of such objects is empty. Its intent is the set of all attributes common to *all* objects in its extent; since the extent is empty, this is conventionally the set of all attributes in the context.
  * **Concept 2** is often called the "top concept". Its extent consists of all objects in the context. Its intent is the set of attributes common to *all* these objects. Since objects 'o1' and 'o2' have no attributes, the set of attributes common to both is empty.

These two concepts are characteristic of a formal context with an empty relation (no "X" marks in the table).
