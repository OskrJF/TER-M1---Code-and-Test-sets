PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and les than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

Formal context from 'eg2_3.csv':
Objects (G): ['o1', 'o2']
Attributes (M): ['a1', 'a2', 'a3']

Calculating formal concepts...

Found 2 formal concepts:
1. Extent: (), Intent: ('a1', 'a2', 'a3')
2. Extent: ('o1', 'o2'), Intent: ()

code\_output` . I should relay this information. The code seems robust enough for small contexts as requested. No further tool calls are needed. I will now respond to the user with the findings.<ctrl95>Based on the provided CSV file  `eg2\_3.csv\`, the formal concepts have been extracted and enumerated using a method suitable for small contexts.

The script first parsed the file to identify the objects and attributes:

  * **Objects (G):** `['o1', 'o2']`
  * **Attributes (M):** `['a1', 'a2', 'a3']`

Then, it calculated all formal concepts. A formal concept is a pair (Extent, Intent), where the Extent is a set of objects and the Intent is a set of attributes, such that the Intent consists of all attributes shared by the objects in the Extent, and the Extent consists of all objects that possess all attributes in the Intent.

The following 2 formal concepts were found:

1.  **Extent:** `()` (empty set of objects)
    **Intent:** `('a1', 'a2', 'a3')` (all attributes)
    *This concept means that the attributes common to an empty set of objects are all attributes, and no object in the context possesses all three attributes ('a1', 'a2', 'a3').*

2.  **Extent:** `('o1', 'o2')` (all objects)
    **Intent:** `()` (empty set of attributes)
    *This concept means that there are no attributes common to both objects 'o1' and 'o2'. Conversely, all objects in the context naturally satisfy the condition of having an empty set of (required) attributes.*

This output suggests that the context in `eg2_3.csv` is likely one where no object 'o1' or 'o2' has any of the attributes 'a1', 'a2', or 'a3', or at least that there are no attributes common to all objects, and no single object possesses all attributes. For instance, if the relation `I` (the set of (object, attribute) pairs) is empty, these two concepts would be the only ones.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
Okay, here is the list of all concepts from the previous analysis of eg2_3.csv, formatted in a single line as you requested:

[[[], [a1, a2, a3]], [[o1, o2], []]]

[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[], [o1, o2]]]
