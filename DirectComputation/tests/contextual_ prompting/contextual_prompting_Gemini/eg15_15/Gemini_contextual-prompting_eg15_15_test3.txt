PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
____________________

OUTPUT:
Okay, I can help you extract and enumerate all formal concepts from the provided CSV file.

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) defines a **formal concept** as a pair $(A, B)$, where $A$ is a set of objects (called the *extent*) and $B$ is a set of attributes (called the *intent*), such that:

1.  All objects in $A$ share all attributes in $B$.
2.  For any object $g$ not in $A$, there is at least one attribute in $B$ that $g$ does not have.
3.  For any attribute $m$ not in $B$, there is at least one object in $A$ that does not have attribute $m$.

This can be expressed using derivation operators: $A' = B$ (attributes common to all objects in $A$) and $B' = A$ (objects possessing all attributes in $B$). Equivalently, a pair $(A,B)$ is a concept if $A' = B$ and $A = B'$. This also implies $A'' = A$ (where $A'' = (A')'$).

For a small context (as specified, less than 20 objects and 20 attributes), we can use a straightforward method:

1.  Iterate through all possible subsets of objects ($A$).
2.  For each subset $A$, calculate its intent $B = A'$.
3.  Then, calculate the extent of $B$, which is $A\_{check} = B'$.
4.  If $A\_{check}$ is identical to the original $A$, then $(A, B)$ is a formal concept.

I will now prepare the Python code to perform this task. The code will:

  * Read the `eg15_15.csv` file, assuming ';' as the delimiter.
  * Transform the 'x' markers into a binary matrix (1 for 'x', 0 otherwise).
  * Implement the derivation operators (`get_intent` and `get_extent`).
  * Iterate through all object subsets to find and list all concepts.

Input context matrix (Objects: 15, Attributes: 15):
Found 2 concepts:
Concept 1:
  Extent (Objects):   ∅
  Intent (Attributes): ('Attr1', 'Attr10', 'Attr11', 'Attr12', 'Attr13', 'Attr14', 'Attr15', 'Attr2', 'Attr3', 'Attr4', 'Attr5', 'Attr6', 'Attr7', 'Attr8', 'Attr9')
--------------------
Concept 2:
  Extent (Objects):   ('O1', 'O10', 'O11', 'O12', 'O13', 'O14', 'O15', 'O2', 'O3', 'O4', 'O5', 'O6', 'O7', 'O8', 'O9')
  Intent (Attributes): ∅
--------------------

```

I've processed your CSV file `eg15_15.csv` to extract and enumerate all formal concepts using a method suitable for small contexts. This method involves iterating through all possible subsets of objects, determining their common attributes (intent), and then finding all objects that share this intent (closure of the extent). If this closure matches the original subset of objects, a formal concept is identified.

For your provided context (15 objects and 15 attributes), the analysis yielded **2 formal concepts**:

-----

## Discovered Formal Concepts 🧐

**Concept 1:**

  * **Extent (Objects):** ∅ (empty set)
  * **Intent (Attributes):** ('Attr1', 'Attr10', 'Attr11', 'Attr12', 'Attr13', 'Attr14', 'Attr15', 'Attr2', 'Attr3', 'Attr4', 'Attr5', 'Attr6', 'Attr7', 'Attr8', 'Attr9')

This is often referred to as the **bottom concept**. It signifies that the set of all attributes provided in your context are possessed by no common objects (hence, an empty extent).

-----

**Concept 2:**

  * **Extent (Objects):** ('O1', 'O10', 'O11', 'O12', 'O13', 'O14', 'O15', 'O2', 'O3', 'O4', 'O5', 'O6', 'O7', 'O8', 'O9')
  * **Intent (Attributes):** ∅ (empty set)

This is often referred to as the **top concept**. It represents that the set of all objects in your context share no common attributes (hence, an empty intent).

-----

These two concepts (the bottom and top concepts) are always present in any formal concept lattice. The fact that only these two were found suggests that your specific context does not have any other combinations of object subsets and attribute subsets that satisfy the conditions for forming additional formal concepts. This often occurs in contexts where there are no non-trivial shared patterns of attributes among subsets of objects.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
____________________

OUTPUT:
Okay, I will format the list of concepts found previously into a single line as per your specification.

Based on the previous analysis of `eg15_15.csv`, the two concepts found were:

1.  Extent: `()` (empty set), Intent: `('Attr1', 'Attr10', 'Attr11', 'Attr12', 'Attr13', 'Attr14', 'Attr15', 'Attr2', 'Attr3', 'Attr4', 'Attr5', 'Attr6', 'Attr7', 'Attr8', 'Attr9')`
2.  Extent: `('O1', 'O10', 'O11', 'O12', 'O13', 'O14', 'O15', 'O2', 'O3', 'O4', 'O5', 'O6', 'O7', 'O8', 'O9')`, Intent: `()`

Formatted into the single line `[[extent_1, intent_1], [extent_2, intent_2]]` without quotation marks around the item names, this becomes:

```
[[[Attr1, Attr10, Attr11, Attr12, Attr13, Attr14, Attr15, Attr2, Attr3, Attr4, Attr5, Attr6, Attr7, Attr8, Attr9], []], [[], [O1, O10, O11, O12, O13, O14, O15, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7, O8, O9]]]
```
