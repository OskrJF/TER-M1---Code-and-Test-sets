PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and les than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

OUTPUT:
### Understanding the Context

First, let's understand the given context from the CSV file. The context is as follows:

- **Objects (rows):** o1, o2
- **Attributes (columns):** a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9

The table shows which objects have which attributes (marked with "yes") and which do not (marked with "no"):

| Objet | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | a5 | a6 | a7 | a8 | a9 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| o1    | yes| yes| yes| yes| no | no | yes| no | yes|
| o2    | yes| no | no | yes| no | yes| no | no | yes|

### Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) Basics

In FCA, a **formal concept** is a pair (A, B), where:
- **A** is a set of objects (extent).
- **B** is a set of attributes (intent).
- Every object in A has all attributes in B.
- There is no larger set of objects than A that also has all attributes in B.
- There is no larger set of attributes than B that is also shared by all objects in A.

The set of all formal concepts forms a **concept lattice**.

### Step 1: List All Possible Combinations

To find all formal concepts, we can:
1. Start with all possible subsets of objects and find their common attributes.
2. Start with all possible subsets of attributes and find their common objects.

Given the small size (2 objects and 9 attributes), it's manageable to enumerate all possibilities.

### Step 2: Find All Formal Concepts

#### Approach:
For each subset of objects, find the set of common attributes (intent). Then, verify if this pair is a formal concept by checking the reverse (i.e., the set of objects that have all these attributes is exactly the original subset).

Similarly, we can do the same starting from attribute subsets.

However, a more systematic way is to use the **NextClosure algorithm** or **Ganter's algorithm**, but for this small context, we can do it manually.

#### Enumerating Concepts:

1. **Concept 1: (All objects, Common attributes of all objects)**
   - Extent: {o1, o2}
   - Intent: Intersection of attributes of o1 and o2.
     - o1: a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9
     - o2: a1, a4, a6, a9
     - Common: a1, a4, a9
   - Check: Which objects have {a1, a4, a9}? Both o1 and o2.
   - Concept: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})

2. **Concept 2: (o1, Attributes of o1)**
   - Extent: {o1}
   - Intent: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
   - Check: Which objects have {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}? Only o1.
   - Concept: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})

3. **Concept 3: (o2, Attributes of o2)**
   - Extent: {o2}
   - Intent: {a1, a4, a6, a9}
   - Check: Which objects have {a1, a4, a6, a9}? Only o2.
   - Concept: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})

4. **Concept 4: (Empty set of objects, All attributes)**
   - Extent: {}
   - Intent: All attributes (since no object is selected, all attributes are trivially shared).
   - Check: Which objects have all attributes? None, so extent is {}.
   - Concept: ({}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})

Now, we need to check if there are any other combinations where a subset of objects shares a set of attributes not already covered.

5. **Check for other object subsets:**
   - Only subsets are {}, {o1}, {o2}, {o1, o2}, which we've already covered.

6. **Check for other attribute subsets:**
   - For example, take {a1, a4}:
     - Objects with {a1, a4}: o1 and o2.
     - But this intent is {a1, a4, a9}, which is already covered by Concept 1.
   - Take {a1}:
     - Objects with {a1}: o1 and o2.
     - Intent is {a1, a4, a9}, same as Concept 1.
   - Take {a2}:
     - Objects with {a2}: only o1.
     - Intent is {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}, same as Concept 2.
   - Similarly, other attribute subsets will lead to one of the existing concepts.

Thus, no additional concepts are found beyond the four already listed.

### Final List of Formal Concepts:

1. **({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})**
   - All objects share attributes a1, a4, a9.

2. **({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})**
   - Only o1 has attributes a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9.

3. **({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})**
   - Only o2 has attributes a1, a4, a6, a9.

4. **({}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})**
   - No object has all attributes (trivial concept).

### Verification:

To ensure completeness, we can verify that:
- For any subset of objects, its intent is covered.
- For any subset of attributes, its extent is covered.
- No additional (A, B) pairs satisfy the formal concept definition beyond these four.

### Concept Lattice:

The concept lattice can be ordered by inclusion of extents (or reverse inclusion of intents):

- Top: ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})
  - Child: ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})
  - Child: ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})
    - Child: ({}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})

### Conclusion:

The complete list of formal concepts (lattice concepts) for the given context is:

1. **({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})**
2. **({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})**
3. **({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})**
4. **({}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})**
