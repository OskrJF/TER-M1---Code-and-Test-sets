Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]]]
Here's how these concepts are derived:

Extent:
emptyset, Intent: a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9. There are no attributes common to all objects.
Extent: o1, Intent: a1,a2,a3,a4,a7,a9. These are the attributes of object o1.
Extent: o2, Intent: a1,a4,a6,a9. These are the attributes of object o2.
Extent: o1,o2, Intent: a1,a4,a9. These are the attributes shared by both objects o1 and o2.
