Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Okay, I understand. Based on the provided CSV data, the formal context is:

Objects (G): {o1, o2}
Attributes (M): {a1, a2, a3}
Incidence Relation (I):
(o1, a1) ∈ I
(o1, a2) ∈ I
(o2, a2) ∈ I
(o2, a3) ∈ I
Now, let's identify all the lattice concepts:

The set of all objects {o1, o2} has the common attribute {a2}. This gives us the concept ({o1, o2}, {a2}).
The object {o1} has the attributes {a1, a2}. This gives us the concept ({o1}, {a1, a2}).
The object {o2} has the attributes {a2, a3}. This gives us the concept ({o2}, {a2, a3}).
There are no objects that share all three attributes {a1, a2, a3}, so we look at combinations of attributes. The objects that have {a1, a2} are {o1}. The objects that have {a1, a3} is the empty set. The objects that have {a2, a3} are {o2}.
The set of all attributes {a1, a2, a3} is shared by no objects, giving us the concept ({}, {a1, a2, a3}).
Therefore, the lattice concepts are:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
