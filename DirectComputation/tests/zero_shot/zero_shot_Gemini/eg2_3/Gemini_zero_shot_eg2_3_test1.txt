Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Based on the provided CSV data, the formal context can be represented as follows:

Objects (G): {o1, o2}
Attributes (M): {a1, a2, a3}
Incidence Relation (I):
(o1, a1) ∈ I
(o1, a2) ∈ I
(o2, a2) ∈ I
(o2, a3) ∈ I
Now, let's derive the lattice concepts:

Extent: {}, Intent: {a1, a2, a3}. The common attributes of all objects is the empty set.
Extent: {o1}, Intent: {a1, a2}. The common attributes of {o1} are a1 and a2.
Extent: {o2}, Intent: {a2, a3}. The common attributes of {o2} are a2 and a3.
Extent: {o1, o2}, Intent: {a2}. The common attribute of {o1, o2} is a2.
Extent: {o1}, Intent: {a1, a2}. (Redundant, already listed)
Extent: {o2}, Intent: {a2, a3}. (Redundant, already listed)
Extent: {}, Intent: {a1, a2, a3}. (Redundant, already listed)
Therefore, the lattice concepts are:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
