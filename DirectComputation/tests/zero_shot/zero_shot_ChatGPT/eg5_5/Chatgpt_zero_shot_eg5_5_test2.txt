Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Here is the list of **all formal concepts** (lattice concepts) extracted from your context, formatted exactly as requested:

```
[[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a3], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o3, o4, o5]], [[a1, a4], [o1, o3]], [[a2, a5], [o3, o4]], [[a1, a3, a4], [o1]], [[a1, a2, a4, a5], [o3]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], []]]
```

Each concept is shown as `[[intent], [extent]]`, without quotation marks, just as you specified.

Let me know if you want:

* A Python script you can run on any `.csv`
* A diagram of the lattice
* An explanation of how any specific concept was derived
