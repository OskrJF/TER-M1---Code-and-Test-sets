PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts
____________________

OUTPUT:
I'll help you extract and enumerate all lattice concepts from your formal context using formal concept analysis (FCA).

First, let me analyze the context you've provided in the CSV file. This is a formal context with objects (o1, o2) and attributes (a1, a2, a3).

A formal context in FCA is represented as a triple (G, M, I) where:
- G is a set of objects
- M is a set of attributes
- I is a binary relation between G and M (i.e., I ⊆ G × M)

From your CSV:
- G = {o1, o2}
- M = {a1, a2, a3}
- I is the relation indicated by "yes" values

Let me represent the binary relation as a table:

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| o1     | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | yes | yes |

Now, to find the concepts, I need to compute all pairs (A, B) where:
- A is a subset of G
- B is a subset of M
- A is the set of all objects that share all attributes in B
- B is the set of all attributes shared by all objects in A

Let me enumerate all concepts:

1. For A = ∅ (empty set of objects):
   - The intent B = {a1, a2, a3} (all attributes)
   - But checking if A is the extent of B: no objects have all attributes
   - So (∅, {a1, a2, a3}) is not a valid concept

2. For A = {o1}:
   - The intent B = {a1, a2} (attributes of o1)
   - Checking if A is the extent of B: objects having both a1 and a2 are {o1}
   - So ({o1}, {a1, a2}) is a valid concept

3. For A = {o2}:
   - The intent B = {a2, a3} (attributes of o2)
   - Checking if A is the extent of B: objects having both a2 and a3 are {o2}
   - So ({o2}, {a2, a3}) is a valid concept

4. For A = {o1, o2}:
   - The intent B = {a2} (attributes common to both o1 and o2)
   - Checking if A is the extent of B: objects having a2 are {o1, o2}
   - So ({o1, o2}, {a2}) is a valid concept

5. For A = G (all objects):
   - The intent B = {a2} (attributes common to all objects)
   - This is the same as case 4

6. For B = ∅ (empty set of attributes):
   - The extent A = G (all objects)
   - But checking if B is the intent of A: common attributes are {a2}, not ∅
   - So (G, ∅) is not a valid concept

Therefore, the complete list of concepts for this formal context is:
1. ({o1}, {a1, a2})
2. ({o2}, {a2, a3})
3. ({o1, o2}, {a2})

These concepts form a concept lattice where ({o1, o2}, {a2}) is the supremum and there is no infimum in this particular case since we don't have a concept with empty extent.

Would you like me to draw the concept lattice diagram or explain any particular aspect of these concepts in more detail?

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

OUTPUT:
[[[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]
