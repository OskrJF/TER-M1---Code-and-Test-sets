Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:
I'll analyze this formal context and extract all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).

The formal context can be represented as:

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| o1     | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | yes | yes |

Now I'll identify all concepts (A,B) where A is a set of objects and B is a set of attributes such that:
- A contains all objects that have all attributes in B
- B contains all attributes shared by all objects in A

Let me find all the concepts:

1. For the set of objects {o1, o2}:
   - Common attributes: {a2}
   - So ({o1, o2}, {a2}) is a concept

2. For the set of objects {o1}:
   - Attributes of o1: {a1, a2}
   - So ({o1}, {a1, a2}) is a concept

3. For the set of objects {o2}:
   - Attributes of o2: {a2, a3}
   - So ({o2}, {a2, a3}) is a concept

4. For the empty set of objects {}:
   - All possible attributes: {a1, a2, a3}
   - So ({}, {a1, a2, a3}) is a concept

5. For the set of all objects {o1, o2}:
   - Common attributes: {a2}
   - So ({o1, o2}, {a2}) is a concept (already identified in #1)

I've identified all concepts in the lattice for this formal context.

As requested, here is the list of concepts in the specified format:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
