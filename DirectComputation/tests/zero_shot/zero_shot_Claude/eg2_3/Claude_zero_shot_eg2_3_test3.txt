Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

I'll analyze this formal context and extract all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis principles.

The formal context from your CSV file is:

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|
| o1     | yes | yes | no  |
| o2     | no  | yes | yes |

To find all concepts, I'll systematically identify the pairs (A,B) where A is a set of objects and B is a set of attributes such that:
- A contains exactly those objects that have all attributes in B
- B contains exactly those attributes shared by all objects in A

Let me work through this step by step:

1. Consider the set of all objects G = {o1, o2}:
   - Common attributes: {a2}
   - This gives the concept ({o1, o2}, {a2})

2. Consider the object set {o1}:
   - Attributes of o1: {a1, a2}
   - This gives the concept ({o1}, {a1, a2})

3. Consider the object set {o2}:
   - Attributes of o2: {a2, a3}
   - This gives the concept ({o2}, {a2, a3})

4. Consider the empty set of objects {}:
   - All attributes: {a1, a2, a3}
   - This gives the concept ({}, {a1, a2, a3})

I should also check for any other potential concepts by examining attribute combinations:

- For attribute set {a1}: Objects having a1 = {o1}
  - All attributes of {o1} = {a1, a2}
  - This gives the concept ({o1}, {a1, a2}) which we already found

- For attribute set {a3}: Objects having a3 = {o2}
  - All attributes of {o2} = {a2, a3}
  - This gives the concept ({o2}, {a2, a3}) which we already found

I've now identified all concepts in this lattice.

Following your requested format, here are all the lattice concepts:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]
