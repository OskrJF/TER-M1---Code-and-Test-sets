Prompt:

PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks

-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

I'll analyze this formal context and extract all the lattice concepts using Formal Concept Analysis principles.

The formal context from your CSV file is:

| Object | a1  | a2  | a3  | a4  | a5  | a6  | a7  | a8  | a9  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| o1     | yes | yes | yes | yes | no  | no  | yes | no  | yes |
| o2     | yes | no  | no  | yes | no  | yes | no  | no  | yes |

Now I'll identify all concepts (A,B) where A is a set of objects and B is a set of attributes.

Let me work through this systematically:

1. Consider the set of all objects G = {o1, o2}:
   - Common attributes: {a1, a4, a9}
   - This gives the concept ({o1, o2}, {a1, a4, a9})

2. Consider the object set {o1}:
   - Attributes of o1: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9}
   - This gives the concept ({o1}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9})

3. Consider the object set {o2}:
   - Attributes of o2: {a1, a4, a6, a9}
   - This gives the concept ({o2}, {a1, a4, a6, a9})

4. Consider the empty set of objects {}:
   - All attributes: {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9}
   - This gives the concept ({}, {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9})

I should also check for any other potential concepts by examining attribute combinations, but I've already captured all possible concepts in this simple context with just two objects.

Following your requested format, here are all the lattice concepts:

[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9], []]]
