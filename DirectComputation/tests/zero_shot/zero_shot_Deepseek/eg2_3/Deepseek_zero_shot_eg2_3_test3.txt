Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:
[[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3], []]]]  

### Explanation:
1. **`[[], [o1, o2]]`** – The bottom concept (all objects, no shared attributes).  
2. **`[[a2], [o1, o2]]`** – The concept where `a2` is shared by all objects (`o1, o2`).  
3. **`[[a1, a2], [o1]]`** – The concept where `o1` has attributes `a1` and `a2`.  
4. **`[[a2, a3], [o2]]`** – The concept where `o2` has attributes `a2` and `a3`.  
5. **`[[a1, a2, a3], []]`** – The top concept (all attributes, no object satisfies all of them).  

This is the complete list of formal concepts for the given context.
