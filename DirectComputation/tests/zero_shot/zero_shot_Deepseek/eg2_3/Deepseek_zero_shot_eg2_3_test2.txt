Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Here is the complete list of formal concepts for the given context in the specified format:  

[[[a1, a2, a3], []], [[a1, a2], [o1]], [[a2, a3], [o2]], [[a2], [o1, o2]]]  

### Explanation:  
1. **Top Concept (All Attributes, No Objects)**:  
   - Attributes: `[a1, a2, a3]`  
   - Objects: `[]` (since no object has all attributes)  

2. **Concept for `{o1}`**:  
   - Attributes: `[a1, a2]` (shared by `o1`)  
   - Objects: `[o1]`  

3. **Concept for `{o2}`**:  
   - Attributes: `[a2, a3]` (shared by `o2`)  
   - Objects: `[o2]`  

4. **Bottom Concept (Shared Attributes, All Objects)**:  
   - Attributes: `[a2]` (only `a2` is shared by both `o1` and `o2`)  
   - Objects: `[o1, o2]`  

This is the complete concept lattice for the given context.
