Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Here is the complete enumeration of all formal concepts for the given context in the requested format:

[[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a9], [o1, o2]], [[a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []]]]

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Bottom Concept**: All objects, empty intent
   - `[[], [o1, o2]]`

2. **Single Attribute Concepts**:
   - Only attribute a9 is shared by both objects
   - `[[a9], [o1, o2]]`

3. **Pairwise Attribute Concepts**:
   - Attributes a4 and a9 are shared by both
   - `[[a4, a9], [o1, o2]]`
   - Attributes a1, a4, and a9 are shared by both
   - `[[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]`

4. **Object-Specific Concepts**:
   - Full intent for o1
   - `[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]]`
   - Full intent for o2
   - `[[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]]`

5. **Top Concept**: Full intent, empty extent
   - `[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []]`

This represents the complete concept lattice structure for the given context. The concepts are ordered from most general (bottom) to most specific (top), showing all possible combinations of objects and their shared attributes. Each concept is represented as [attributes, objects] where the attributes are shared by all objects in the extent, and the objects have all attributes in the intent.
