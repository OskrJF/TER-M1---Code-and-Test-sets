Prompt:
Within the context of formal concept analysis (FCA), given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks


-----------------------------------

OUTPUT:

Here is the complete list of formal concepts for the given context in the specified format:

[[[[], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]], [[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]], [[a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []]]]

### Explanation:
1. **Bottom concept**: All objects, no shared attributes (trivially true)
   - `[[], [o1, o2]]`

2. **Attributes shared by both objects**: 
   - `o1` and `o2` share attributes a1, a4, a9
   - `[[a1, a4, a9], [o1, o2]]`

3. **Concept for o1**: 
   - o1 has attributes a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9
   - `[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a7, a9], [o1]]`

4. **Concept for o2**: 
   - o2 has attributes a1, a4, a6, a9
   - `[[a1, a4, a6, a9], [o2]]`

5. **Top concept**: All attributes, no objects (since no object has all attributes)
   - `[[a1, a2, a3, a4, a6, a7, a9], []]`

This represents the complete concept lattice for the given context. The concepts are ordered from most general (bottom) to most specific (top). Each concept is represented as [attributes, objects] where the attributes are shared by all objects in the extent, and the objects have all attributes in the intent.
