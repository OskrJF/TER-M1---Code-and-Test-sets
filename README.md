# Presentation
This repository contains data related to a research supervised project within the Master Intégration de Compétences (ICo) at Montpellier University.

The project consisted to explore the question: "can LLMs compute the full set of concepts of a formal context — a task known to be highly combinatorial?"

We explored this question using two approaches: 

* the first ("direct computation") consisted of asking the LLMs directly for the list of concepts.
* the second ("code generation") involved asking them to produce code that performs the computation, which we then tested. 

We selected a benchmark of formal contexts of various sizes, several LLM models, and multiple prompting strategies. 

The project has been selected for presentation at
[Consoft @ CONCEPTS 2025](https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/consoft/) 

# Benchmark

* Directory "Synthetics" contains a set of randomly generated formal contexts of increasing size (from 2x3 to 50x50), with incidence probability p=0.5.
* Real formal contexts have been selected in UCI Machine Learning Repository  ([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/]()), then binarized by A. Gutierrez for [FCA4J]({https://www.lirmm.fr/fca4j) evaluation and are available at [https://gite.lirmm.fr/gutierre/fca4j-benchmark]()
