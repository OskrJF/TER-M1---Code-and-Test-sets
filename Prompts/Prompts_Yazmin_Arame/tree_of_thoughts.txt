PROMPT 1A (repeat three times, take one of the solutions from each try for PROMPT 1B):
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes. Write a single paragraph for each way

PROMPT 1B:
Pick one of the next three ways to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file and apply it to give me the concepts

(insert three of the ways suggested with prompt 1A)

PROMPT 2B:
Put the list of concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
