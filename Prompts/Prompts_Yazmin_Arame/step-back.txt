PROMPT 1: 
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), give me three ways to find the lattice concepts in a context with less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes

PROMPT 2: 
Pick one of the three ways that you mentioned to extract all the lattice concepts from the context in this .csv file

PROMPT 3:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
