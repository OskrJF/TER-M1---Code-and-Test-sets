PROMPT 1:
In the field of formal concept analysis (FCA), we can find the lattice concepts from small contexts (less than 20 objects and less than 20 attributes) by simple methods rather than powerful algorithms.
Given this .csv file with a context, I want you to extract and enumerate all lattice concepts.

PROMPT 2:
Put the list of all concepts in a single line with this format: [[[], [o1, o2, o3, o4, o5]], [[a1], [o1, o3, o4]], [[a1, a2, a3, a5], [o4]]], without any quotation marks
